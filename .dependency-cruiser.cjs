/**
 * The dependency rules, as something a machine checks rather than something a comment asks for.
 *
 * The boundaries in this repository are real and were written down in AGENTS.md — core is platform
 * independent, the renderer may not pull core's values into a browser bundle, and so on. What was
 * missing is anything that notices when one is crossed. The comment on `core/src/index.ts` explains
 * that importing a *value* from it blanks the window; nothing stopped anyone from doing it.
 *
 * Rules start at `warn` when their violations have not been cleaned up yet, and move to `error` in
 * the commit that empties them. A rule that is red on arrival teaches people to ignore the tool —
 * the same reason `knip` runs with `--no-exit-code` in CI.

			 * This was `warn` with a comment saying "the number is the thing to watch". Nothing was
			 * watching: it went from 53 to 159 without a single check going red, which is what a
			 * warning costs when there is no ratchet under it. Waiting for zero before turning it
			 * red was the plan, and three months of drift is the evidence that the plan does not
			 * survive contact with ordinary work.
			 *
			 * So the two halves are separated. The rule is red — a *new* cycle fails the build
			 * today. The 159 that are already here are listed in
			 * `.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json` and pass, because failing the build for
			 * something somebody else wrote last month teaches people to ignore the tool, the same
			 * reason this comment used to give for staying yellow.
			 *
			 * The baseline is a file that can only be regenerated deliberately, so shrinking it is
			 * a visible act and growing it is one somebody has to defend in review. Untangling one
			 * hub — `features/dock` accounts for most of desktop's 119 — and regenerating is the
			 * expected way this number goes down.
