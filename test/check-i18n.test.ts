/**
 * The check that guards seven languages, checked.
 *
 * `scripts/check-i18n.mjs` reported zero hardcoded Chinese for months while four real strings sat
 * in the renderer: an `aria-label`, a `hint`, a relay label under the QR code and the word 「字符」
 * in a counter. Both causes were in the scanner, not in the code it scans —
 *
 *   `//` inside a string was read as the start of a comment, so everything after the first
 *   `https://` on a line was thrown away, and this codebase puts an example URL in a placeholder
 *   next to the label it is placed beside
 *
 *   a JSX text run was matched with `>([^<>]*)<`, which stops at any `>` — including the one in
 *   `{pages > 1 ? … : …}`, four characters before the word it was supposed to find
 *
 * A green check nobody has tested is a claim, and this one was wrong in the direction that does
 * not announce itself. So the scanner has tests now, and they are the cases that beat it.
