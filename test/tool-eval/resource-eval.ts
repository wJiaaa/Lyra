/**
 * Does a model actually use an address once the prompt mentions one?
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types test/tool-eval/resource-eval.ts [model]
 *
 * The unit tests prove `skill://pdf` resolves. They cannot prove the thing that decides whether
 * any of this was worth building: that a model reaches for an address instead of hunting the
 * filesystem for the same file, or instead of answering from whatever it already believes.
 *
 * Both failure modes are quiet. A model that greps for SKILL.md gets the right answer by a longer
 * route and nothing looks wrong. A model that answers from memory produces a plausible paragraph
 * about a file format it has never read.
