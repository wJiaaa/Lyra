/**
 * Which rule found the risk, as a code the interface can translate.
 *
 * The approval card used to receive the reason as a finished Chinese sentence, written into the
 * top of `detail` by the gate — so an English, Japanese or Russian window showed 「强制推送会覆盖
 * 远程历史」 above the command. The rules now name themselves with a code, keep their own wording
 * beside it for the log and for callers without translations, and the gate hands both over next to
 * `detail` instead of inside it.
