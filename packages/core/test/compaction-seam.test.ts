/**
 * That binding a compaction strategy does not turn features off.
 *
 * `compactWith` used to take seven positional arguments and forward four of them to the bound
 * strategy. The desktop binds one at boot, so on the only host that ships, automatic compaction
 * ran with no overhead accounting (the threshold ignored the system prompt and every tool schema,
 * which is the case the code's own comment says lands over the line and then compacts on every
 * turn), no artifact sink (so a pruned placeholder advertised an `artifact://` address that had
 * nothing behind it) and no summarizer (so the `compact` model was ignored). All three
 * type-checked. None of it was visible.
 *
 * These tests fail against that shape and are cheap to keep, which is the point: the request is
 * one object now, and a field added to it either reaches the strategy or fails to compile.
