/**
 * The read boundary, as one rule with several doors into it.
 *
 * There used to be two rules. The file tools refused anything outside the workspace; `bash` was
 * governed by a sandbox that denies writes and says nothing about reads, behind a read-only table
 * that skips the approval path entirely. So the same question — may this file be read — had
 * opposite answers depending on which tool asked it, and `cat` was the answer that always won.
 *
 * These tests are mostly about that asymmetry: every one of them that names both a file tool and a
 * shell command is checking that the two agree.

 * 不删目录。前一种最糟——产品一回归，`cat` 真跑起来，那把真钥匙就进了断言信息和 CI 日志。
 *
 * `home()` 每次都现读 `os.homedir()`，换掉 `HOME`（Windows 上它认 `USERPROFILE`）代码就跟着换。
 * 可这间屋子不能开在临时目录里：临时区按设计就是可读的（`assessRead` 的 `tmpdir()` 和

 * 变成空话。所以它开在真家目录底下，是一个新建的空目录——这里建的一切都在它里面，跑完连它一起
 * 删掉；真家目录里原有的东西一样不读、不写。

 * git 也要拦在这间屋子门口。「工作区里的日常操作一句都不问」那条会真的跑 `git commit`，而有人的
