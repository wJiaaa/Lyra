/**
 * An escalation reaches a person in `auto` mode.
 *
 * `auto` runs commands confined to the project and lets the approval policy wave through the ones
 * it has nothing against — the sandbox is what makes that safe. An escalation asks to run outside
 * the sandbox, so the policy's opinion cannot be what answers it. It was: the gate handed
 * `assessCommand` the request's subject, `escalate:danger-full-access:<command>`, which found no
 * program it knew in the first word, and the command ran unconfined with nobody asked — `rm -rf`
 * included.
 *
 * Everything goes through the real `bash` tool and the real gate. Only the sandbox is swapped, for
 * one that records what it was handed and runs nothing, so no verdict here can execute anything.
