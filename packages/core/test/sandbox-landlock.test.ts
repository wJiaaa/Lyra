/**
 * The Landlock backend, as a real Linux kernel enforces it.
 *
 * The rules are data and are tested as data on every platform. The rest can only be believed where
 * a kernel has actually applied them: a ruleset built correctly and never enforced looks identical
 * from every other angle — which is how the Windows runner went unnoticed for as long as it did,
 * tested through a probe hook that said yes on its behalf.
 *
 * Forced to Landlock rather than left to selection, because a host with a working `bwrap` would
 * pick that and never exercise this at all.
