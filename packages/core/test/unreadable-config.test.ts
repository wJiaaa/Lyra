/**
 * Configuration files that do not parse the first time — and what must not happen next.
 *
 * `settings.json` that failed to parse was read as a fresh install: no providers, no MCP servers,
 * no hooks, no always-allow list. The desktop saves on any change at all, and the first save wrote
 * those defaults over the file. The commonest way in was not damage but a byte-order mark, which
 * Notepad's "UTF-8 with BOM" and PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` both write — and
 * the same mark made a skill's frontmatter read as body text and a bundle's `.mcp.json` "not JSON".
