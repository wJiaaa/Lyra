/**
 * Reading back what compaction removed from the window.
 *
 * The central test here is the one that runs a session past its context window and then asks for
 * something that was in its very first message. That is the claim the whole compaction design rests
 * on: history leaves the window, it does not leave the session. Without it, summarising aggressively
 * would be a bet that the summary happened to keep whatever turns out to matter — and the safe
 * response to that bet is to summarise as little as possible, which is how a long session becomes
 * unaffordable.
 *
 * Real logs on disk throughout. The thing being tested is whether what was written can be found
 * again, and a fake store answers that question by assuming it.
