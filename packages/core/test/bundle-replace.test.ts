/**
 * Updating and uninstalling a bundle whose files something still has open.
 *
 * On Windows a running `.exe`, or a `.node` module a server has loaded, cannot be deleted. `rm -r`
 * deletes everything around it and then fails: an update left the old version half gone and threw
 * the new one away with the staging directory, and an uninstall left a bundle that was neither
 * installed nor removable. Renaming the directory is refused whole instead — which is what makes
 * "move the old one aside, move the new one in, then delete" something that can be undone.
 *
 * The lock is simulated the way Windows applies it: removing files around the locked one works and
 * then fails, renaming the directory that holds it fails outright.
