/**
 * Asking for more room after being refused.
 *
 * The shape being pinned down here is an ordering: nothing runs before the request is judged, a
 * request that grants nothing never reaches a person, and every refusal is distinguishable from
 * every other so the model can tell "you asked wrong" from "the user said no".
 *
 * The end-to-end half runs the real tool against the real sandbox, because the property that
 * matters — the same command failing, then succeeding once approved — cannot be observed in the
 * pieces.
