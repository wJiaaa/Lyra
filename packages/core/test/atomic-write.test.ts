/**
 * Replacing a file whole: the settings, the vault, the symbol index.
 *
 * Each of these was written through `${path}.${pid}.tmp` and a single `rename`. The session index
 * had already been fixed for both of the ways that goes wrong (`session-index-race.test.ts`); these
 * are the same two failures, for the files that had not been:
 *
 * - one temporary name per process, for writes that run concurrently *inside* a process — two saves
 *   shared it, and the first rename took the file out from under the second (ENOENT);
 * - on Windows a rename onto a file that antivirus or the indexer has open fails for a moment with
 *   EPERM or EBUSY, and that moment was reported as a failed save.
