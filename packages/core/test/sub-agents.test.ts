/**
 * What the sub-agent registry promises to anything watching or steering a delegated run.
 *
 * Delegation used to be write-only — dispatched, then a paragraph of answer — so all of this is
 * about the two things that were missing: seeing what a sub-agent is doing, and being able to
 * change its course without killing it.
 *
 * The claims worth testing are the ones where getting it wrong is silent. A record stuck on
 * `running` after its run threw looks exactly like work still in progress. A finished sub-agent
 * that still accepts steering swallows the message and reports nothing. Retiring the wrong record
 * throws away the transcript somebody is reading.
