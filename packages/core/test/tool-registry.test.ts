/**
 * That every tool written is a tool the model is told about.
 *
 * The defect this exists for: the kernel's tools plugin registered four groups, `tools/index.ts`
 * kept a flat list beside them, and `rule`, `recall`, `learn`, `lsp` and `web_search` were only in
 * the flat one. The desktop binds the kernel registry, so on the desktop those five did not exist.
 * They type-checked, they had tests, they were shipped — and 23,000 tool calls of real session logs
 * contain not one of them. Nothing compared the two lists.
 *
 * So the assertion is not "the two lists agree" (they now read the same constant, which makes that
 * true by construction and therefore worthless). It is against the source tree: every `*Tool`
 * exported under `src/tools/` has to reach the registry. Forgetting to register the next one fails
 * here rather than in a year of nobody noticing.
