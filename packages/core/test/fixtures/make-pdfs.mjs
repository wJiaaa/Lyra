/**
 * Prints the PDF fixtures next to this file, using Electron's own `printToPDF`.
 *
 * The fixtures are committed rather than produced during the test run, because the run happens in
 * two places that cannot produce them:
 *
 *   - Linux CI has no display, so Electron does not start at all.
 *   - macOS CI has a display but no Chinese font. `printToPDF` still succeeds there and writes a
 *     valid PDF — with the Chinese set in tofu, which carries no text. The three fixtures that
 *     exist to test Chinese extraction came back empty and the assertions failed on content, not
 *     on a missing file, which is the more confusing of the two failures.
 *
 * So they are printed once, here, on a real desktop with real fonts, and read from disk by the
 * test. Same production line as the PDFs a person actually receives — just not the same minute.
 *
 * Re-run after changing what a fixture must contain:
 *
 *   node packages/desktop/test/fixtures/make-pdfs.mjs
 *
 * It needs a machine with a display and a CJK font installed; a headless run would quietly write
 * the same tofu that CI does.
