/**
 * The Windows runner, really started — not through a probe hook.
 *
 * Every other Windows sandbox test injects `probe: () => true`, which is how the runner went its
 * whole life without once starting: Electron in Node mode read `--plume-sandbox-runner` as one of
 * Node's own options and exited 9, the real probe failed, and on Windows the default permission
 * mode ran no command at all. Nothing here is injected. It starts the runner the way the app does,
 * through PowerShell — the shell a confined command runs in there (`commandShell`) — and checks what
 * a person would check: the project writes, the rest of the disk does not, and the things a shell
 * needs still work.
