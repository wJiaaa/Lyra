/**
 * One session, one `updatedAt` — whichever of the store's three copies is asked.
 *
 * The store keeps a session's meta in memory (the append queue's view), in `index.json`, and in the
 * log itself, and rebuilds the first two from the third when the index is missing or unreadable. A
 * new session took the time twice: the meta record on disk said T0, the index said T1. A rebuild
 * then put T0 back into memory, and moving or archiving — which must keep `updatedAt` as it was —
 * kept the wrong one. Only when the two calls straddled a millisecond, which is why
 * `session-move.test.ts` failed now and then, and more often on Windows, where the index read that
 * triggers a rebuild is the one antivirus gets in the way of.
 *
 * A clock that moves one millisecond per call makes every straddle happen, every time.
