/* oxlint-disable react-hooks/rules-of-hooks -- `useCompaction` installs the compaction strategy; the name predates this rule and has nothing to do with React */

/**
 * A delegated run compacts its own context, the same way the session that dispatched it does.
 *
 * It was the one that did not. `runSubAgent` built its `runTurn` config without a `compact`
 * callback, so a sub-agent's history only ever grew — and a sub-agent is the run most likely to
 * need compaction, because sixty turns of reading files is precisely what it is dispatched to do.
 * What that looked like was not degradation but a wall: the provider refuses the request for being
 * over the window, `task` turns the throw into a tool error, and delegation appears to fail on big
 * jobs while working on small ones.
 *
 * Driven through the real `runSubAgent` with the compaction strategy replaced, because what is
 * being checked is the wiring — that the loop is handed a `compact` at all, and that it is handed
 * this run's own overhead rather than the parent's.
