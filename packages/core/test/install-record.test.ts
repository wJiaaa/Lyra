/**
 * Whether a bundle is behind what its registry now offers.
 *
 * The interesting cases are all refusals. An update badge that cannot be cleared is worse than no
 * badge at all: pressing the button beside it reinstalls the same bytes and the badge comes back,
 * so the page is now lying about something the user cannot fix.
 *
 * The version strings here are the real ones from the live catalogue, because they are the reason
 * the comparison is ordered the way it is — `0.0.0` and `0.0.0-30bf9a1` are what most of it
 * actually publishes.
