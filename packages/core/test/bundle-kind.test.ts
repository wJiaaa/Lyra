/**
 * What a directory is, decided by what it holds.
 *
 * The rule these tests pin down is the one that separates a plugin from an MCP server, and it
 * exists because the alternative had already happened: a catalogue of nine "plugins" of which
 * seven were a single `.mcp.json` and no skills — real MCP servers, listed and installed as
 * plugins, and then absent from the MCP settings page because that page reads the settings file
 * and these had gone into a plugin directory instead.
 *
 * Nothing here asks the manifest what it thinks it is. A bundle that says nothing and a bundle
 * that says the wrong thing must both come out the same way, because the registry index this was
 * built against says the wrong thing about seven of its nine entries.
