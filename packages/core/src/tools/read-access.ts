/**
 * Whether a path may be read — one answer, for every way of reading one.
 *
 * This exists because there used to be two answers. The file tools resolved a path against the
 * workspace and refused anything outside it (`resolveWorkspacePath`), while `bash` asked a
 * different question entirely: the sandbox modes govern *writes* (`sandbox/policy.ts` denies
 * `file-write*` and nothing else), and `isReadOnlyCommand` waves `cat`/`head`/`grep` past the
 * approval path altogether. So `read ../other-project/x` was refused and `cat ../other-project/x`
 * succeeded silently, in every permission mode including the strictest one.
 *
 * That gap was not theoretical. It cost a credential rule its teeth — `SECRET_PATH` correctly
 * judges `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` risky, and nobody was ever asked, because the only caller sits
 * behind the read-only table. And it taught the model to route around the file tools: refusing a
 * read it can obviously perform is an instruction to find another way, which is exactly what
 * `paths.ts` records happening once before with an MCP filesystem server.
 *
 * The shape of the fix is a judgement that does not know which tool is asking:
 *
 *   - `allow` — the workspace, scratch, installed skills, files the user attached, and the system
 *     directories a toolchain reads to function. No prompt, because a prompt that fires on
 *     `ls /usr/bin` is one people learn to click through.
 *   - `ask` — anywhere else. Not a refusal: a refusal is what left the user with no way to say
 *     "yes, read my other project" and left the model with a reason to reach for a shell. The
 *     grant is a directory rather than a file, so approving once opens the project the user meant.
 *
 * Credentials are judged before the workspace rather than after. A key is not damaged by being
 * read, it is spent, and "it happened to be inside the project" is not a reason to hand one over
 * without asking. The grant for one is the file itself — approving a key must never widen to the
 * directory holding the rest of them.
