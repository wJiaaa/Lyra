/**
 * The tools that ship with the app, grouped by what they touch.
 *
 * One list, because there used to be two. The kernel's tools plugin registered four groups and
 * `index.ts` kept a flat list of its own beside them — and they drifted apart: `recall`, `learn`,
 * `lsp` and `web_search` (and a since-removed `rule`) only ever reached the flat one. The desktop
 * binds the kernel registry, so for the desktop those five tools did not exist: they were written, tested, shipped,
 * and never advertised to a model. 23,000 tool calls of real session logs contain none of them.
 * Nothing compared the two lists, so nothing said so. `test/tool-registry.test.ts` now does.
 *
 * Grouped rather than flat so a configuration can drop a whole area — an agent with no shell, one
 * that reads but never writes — by not registering that group. The order within a group is the
 * order the model is told about them.
