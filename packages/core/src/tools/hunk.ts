/**
 * The line-anchored patch language behind `edit`.
 *
 * The model names the ORIGINAL line numbers it wants to change and writes only the replacement
 * lines. It never retypes the lines it is keeping, and it never has to reproduce existing bytes
 * exactly — which is what `old_string` demanded and what models are worst at.
 *
 * Measured against the `str_replace` form on this repository's own source
 * (`docs/dev-log/01-edit-format-eval.md`, 270 real calls):
 *
 *   gemini-2.5-flash-lite   first-attempt 78% → 96%, output tokens −49%
 *   gemini-3.7-flash-high   first-attempt 96% → 100%, output tokens −74%
 *
 * The bigger win is not the pass rate. Under `str_replace` ten of the failures were
 * `wrong-result` — the edit applied and produced the wrong file, with nothing to tell anyone.
 * Under this format every failure was a rejection the model could see and retry, because line
 * ranges can be checked against the file and byte anchors cannot.

 * rejecting it bought nothing. A payload line is ambiguous only when it exactly matches the header
 * grammar, and real source lines do not look like `REPLACE 3-7`.
 *
 * What that tolerance must not do is swallow a unified diff. Models write `-old` / `+new` pairs by
 * overwhelming habit, and every unprefixed line used to be taken literally — so the `-` lines were
 * written into the file, verbatim, on top of the replacement. The tool reported success, and the
 * source was quietly broken:
 *
 *     -import { useRegionStore } from '@/store/modules/region'
 *     import { listRegion } from '@/api/region'
 *
 * The discriminator is the *mixture*. A payload where every line omits the prefix is the measured
 * case above and still passes; a payload where every line carries it is the format working as
 * intended. One that does both is a diff, and there is no reading of it that is safe to guess at —
 * so it is rejected, which is what this format promises to do instead of misapplying an edit.

Rules:
- This is NOT a unified diff. NEVER write "-" lines and never write "@@" headers: the range in the
  operation header is the deletion. A "-" line would be written into the file as source.
- Line numbers are the ORIGINAL numbers shown in the file. They NEVER shift, however many
  operations you write.
- A payload line is everything after the leading "+", verbatim, including indentation. A blank
  line is a bare "+".
- Within one operation, either every payload line carries "+" or none of them do. Mixing is
  rejected, because there is then no way to tell which lines are meant literally.
- The range names the original lines you are replacing; the payload may be longer or shorter.
- NEVER widen a range to retype lines you are keeping — use INSERT AFTER instead.
- To remove lines use DELETE, never REPLACE with an empty payload.
- Ranges must not overlap. An insertion cannot sit inside a replaced/deleted range, and each
  insertion anchor may occur only once. Inserting after the range's final line is allowed.
  One line is REPLACE 7-7.
- Put every change to one file in one patch: several operations in one call is normal.`;
