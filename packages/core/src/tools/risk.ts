/**
 * How dangerous an operation is, so that "帮我批准" can mean what it says.
 *
 * The first version of this was an allow-list: a command was waved through only if its first
 * word was one of about thirty read-only programs, and *any* shell metacharacter disqualified
 * it outright. The reasoning was sound in isolation — `ls && rm -rf /` really does start with
 * `ls` — but the effect was that a mode advertised as "only ask about risky things" asked about
 * nearly everything, because models write `cd x && git log; echo ---` rather than bare `ls`.
 * A permission prompt that fires constantly is not a safety feature; it is something people
 * learn to click through, which is strictly worse than not having it.
 *
 * So this inverts: everything is allowed unless it matches something genuinely destructive.
 * The list below is not "things that write" — writing is the job — but "things you cannot take
 * back": deleting, force-pushing, rewriting history, escalating privileges, piping the network
 * into a shell, touching anything outside the project.
