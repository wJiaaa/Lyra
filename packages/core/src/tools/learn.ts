/**
 * Writing down something worth knowing next time.
 *
 * The hard part of this tool is not storing the string. It is getting the model to call it for the
 * right things — and the failure that matters is not silence, it is a memory file full of facts
 * that expire. A note saying `parseFrontmatter` lives in `skills/loader.ts` is true today, is
 * injected into every prompt in this project from now on, and will be quietly wrong after the next
 * refactor. **A stale fact in memory is worse than a missing one, because the model acts on it.**
 *
 * So the description spends most of its length on what not to record, and the test for what stays
 * is whether reading the code would tell you: if it would, the code is the record.
