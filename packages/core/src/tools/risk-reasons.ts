/**
 * Every risk rule's code, and the sentence the rules themselves say it with.
 *
 * A rule that fires reports its code; the host says it in the interface's language by looking the
 * code up in its own catalogues (`risk.<code>` in `packages/desktop/src/i18n/messages`). The
 * sentence here is for everything that shows the finding as it is: the session log, a refusal
 * handed back to the model, a caller with no catalogue of its own.
 *
 * It used to be the only form the finding took, and the approval gate wrote it into the top of the
 * card's text — so every language got the Chinese sentence. Keeping the code beside it is what lets
 * the card change with the window's language, and keeps core free of any host's translations.
 *
 * `{name}` stands for a value the sentence needs, passed along as the verdict's `params`.
