/**
 * Reading a rule's body on demand.
 *
 * The rulebook exists so a rule can be long. A convention about CSS, or about how this repository
 * writes tests, is a page — and a page in the system prompt is a page paid for on every turn of
 * every conversation, including the ones about something else entirely.
 *
 * So the prompt carries a line per rule, and the body waits here. Without this tool that listing
 * would be a menu with no kitchen behind it.
