/**
 * Resolve a path the model wants to **write** and refuse anything that escapes the workspace.
 *
 * The model is not trusted to stay inside the workspace: `../../.ssh/id_rsa` is a normal-looking
 * argument. `write` and `edit` route through here so the containment check exists once.
 *
 * Reading is a different question and is asked elsewhere, in `read-access.ts`: a read outside the
 * workspace is put to the user, because refusing one they could obviously grant is what taught the
 * model to go around the file tools with `cat`. A write is not offered that way — the tools that
 * change files stay inside the project, full stop. The asymmetry is the point, and it is why the
 * attachment set (`ToolContext.allowedPaths`) is honoured over there and has no parameter here:
 * dragging a file into the conversation says "look at this", not "you may overwrite it".
 *
 * The scratch directory is the one exception, because the system prompt sends the model there
 * for anything that should not end up in the user's repository. Refusing it would be telling the
 * model to write somewhere and then stopping it — which is exactly what happened before this,
 * and what it worked around by reaching for an MCP filesystem server instead. Only the scratch
 * subtree is opened up: `~/.lyra` itself still holds settings and transcripts, and stays shut.
