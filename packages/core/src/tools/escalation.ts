/**
 * Asking for more room, after having been refused — the one place that choreography is written.
 *
 * The old shape was: guess whether a command is dangerous, and if it might be, ask before running
 * it. That produces a prompt for everything that *resembles* a risk, which is most things, and a
 * prompt that fires constantly is not a safeguard — it is a step people learn to click through
 * without reading. By the time the one that mattered arrives, it looks like all the others.
 *
 * This is the other order. The command runs, confined. If the sandbox refuses it, the refusal is
 * a fact rather than a prediction, and the model is told in words it can act on: what was denied,
 * and that it may ask once for a wider mode with a reason. The user is asked only then — and what
 * they see is the model's own sentence explaining why, not a lone path they have to judge cold.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating. The number of prompts becomes the number of times the agent
 * actually crossed a line, not the number of times we suspected it might. And a grant is spent on
 * the call that asked for it: nothing accumulates, so a session cannot end up wider than it began.
