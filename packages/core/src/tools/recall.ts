/**
 * Reading back what compaction took out of the window.
 *
 * A summary is lossy by construction, and the loss is the point — a hundred turns cannot be carried
 * verbatim. What makes that acceptable is that the original is not gone: the session log keeps every
 * message ever committed, in full, and this searches it.
 *
 * That changes what compaction is. Without it, summarising is a decision about what the agent is
 * allowed to remember, made once, by a model with no idea what it will need later — so the honest
 * response is to keep as much as possible in the window, which is exactly the pressure that makes
 * long sessions unaffordable. With it, summarising is a cache eviction: the detail is one call away,
 * and the agent can tell when it needs to make that call. Compacting to a tenth of the window stops
 * being reckless.
 *
 * Deliberately not a general file search. `grep` over the log would work and would be terrible: the
 * matches come back as JSON, one line per record, with an entire tool result on the line that
 * matched. This answers in messages, trimmed, oldest first.
