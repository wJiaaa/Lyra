/**
 * Slash commands: prompts the user has written down and can run by name.
 *
 * A command is a markdown file. Its body is a prompt template, its frontmatter says what the
 * command is for, and typing `/name` in the composer sends the body instead of the name. That is
 * the whole idea — the value is not in the mechanism but in not retyping the same careful
 * instructions every week.
 *
 * Four directories are searched, and two of them are not ours:
 *
 *   <project>/.plume/commands/**\/*.md     the project's own, shared through the repository
 *   ~/.plume/commands/**\/*.md             yours, everywhere
 *   <project>/.claude/commands/**\/*.md   what Claude Code reads
 *   ~/.claude/commands/**\/*.md
 *
 * Reading `.claude` is deliberate. That layout is what most people who write these already have,
 * this repository included, and a command file is a prompt in a markdown file — there is nothing
 * in it that belongs to one program. Refusing to read them would mean asking everyone to copy
 * their commands across to be told the same thing back, which is a worse product for no reason
 * beyond wanting our directory to be the only one that counts.
 *
 * Nested directories become namespaced names: `git/commit.md` is `/git:commit`. It is how the same
 * convention names them elsewhere, and it keeps a folder of twenty related commands legible in a
 * list.
