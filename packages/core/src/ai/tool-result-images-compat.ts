/**
 * Where a tool result's image goes on the Responses API — learned from the endpoint, then kept.
 *
 * The protocol puts it inside the result: `function_call_output.output` may be a list with
 * `input_image` parts, and that is the default. Relays that translate Responses into Chat
 * Completions do not all carry that across. Measured 2026-09-27 on a relay serving `glm-5.3-flash`
 * (`e2e/mcp-readonly-probe.ts`), the request with the image was refused outright:
 *
 *     Upstream request failed: [invalid_value] messages[5]: tool content: part type "image_url"
 *     is not supported; only text is
 *
 * and not once: the image stays in history, so every later request in that conversation would be
 * refused the same way. Having been told, the image moves to a user message right after the
 * results — the shape Chat Completions uses anyway — and the request is sent again.
 *
 * In memory only, like the other compat axes: relearning after a restart costs one refused request.
