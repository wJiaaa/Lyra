 * fish, nushell, xonsh or tcsh turned every `export A=1`, every `$(…)` and every `for … do … done`
 * into a syntax error, on the machines where people are most likely to have changed their shell.
 * The previous fallback — `/bin/bash` — is also not a path on a minimal Linux, where it was
 * `spawn /bin/bash ENOENT` for every command; `/bin/sh` is the last resort.
 *
 * zsh runs with `NOMATCH` off. A glob that matches nothing is an error in zsh and a literal in bash,
 * so `ls *.log 2>/dev/null`, `pip install foo[dev]` and `curl https://x/?a=b` all died with
 * `no matches found` before the command even started — each one a bash idiom a model writes without
 * thinking. With the option off, zsh does what bash does.
 *
 * **Windows.** Git Bash first, then PowerShell 7, then Windows PowerShell. This used to be
 * PowerShell alone, chosen on the grounds that it "understands the `&&` … that models write" and
 * that the embedded terminal starts it. The first half is true only of PowerShell 7: the one every
 * Windows actually has is 5.1, where `cd x && npm i` is a parse error — so the commonest shape of
 * command a model writes failed outright. The second half does not carry over: the terminal is for
 * a person, who picks their own shell; this is for a model, whose commands are bash whatever the
 * platform. Git for Windows is what brings `git` to almost every developer's Windows, and it brings
 * bash with it. When it is missing, the model is told which PowerShell it has, so it can write for it.
 *
 * `PLUME_SHELL` overrides all of this, for a bash or zsh or PowerShell installed where none of the
 * searches look.
 *
 * This is the shell for a command that runs unconfined. A confined one on Windows runs in
 * PowerShell instead — see `commandShell`.

 *   whatever `-OutputFormat` says, so the model read XML where a one-line error should have been;
