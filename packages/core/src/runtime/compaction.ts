/**
 * Keeping a long conversation inside a context window.
 *
 * Three mechanisms, cheapest first, and each one is a different answer to a different problem:
 *
 *   1. `prune.ts` cuts oversized tool results. No model, no request, and it alone often suffices —
 *      a session that ran three greps over a large repository is mostly those three results.
 *   2. This file replaces the older half of the history with a structured summary, and hands the
 *      boundary back so the caller can *store* it.
 *   3. `recall` (a tool) reads the original log back on demand, so nothing summarised is actually
 *      lost — only moved out of the window until it is asked for.
 *
 * The third is what makes the second safe to be aggressive about. A summary is lossy by
 * construction; a summary next to a searchable transcript is not, and that is the difference
 * between compacting to a third of the window and compacting to a tenth of it.
 *
 * The second is what makes any of it durable. Compaction used to return a shorter array to the
 * running loop and nothing more — so the next prompt rebuilt its history from the log, got every
 * original message back, and compacted again from scratch. The conversation could never be smaller
 * than the log, and the log only grows. That is the whole of "stuck at 80%, compacting every turn":
 * not an arithmetic error in what to cut, but a result that was thrown away as soon as it was made.
 * So compaction now returns what was summarised and where the boundary fell, and the session
 * writes both down.
