 * What this project taught us, kept where the project can be found again.

 * So in practice it holds what a user typed into a settings box, which is a small fraction of what
 * is worth remembering.
 *
 * The layer that was missing is the project one, and it is the valuable one. "This repository uses
 * pnpm, not npm" is true here and false three directories over; filed globally it is a fact that
 * will be wrong for the next project and applied anyway.
 *
 * Two files rather than one, and the split is load-bearing:
 *
 *   `learned.md` holds what somebody wrote down on purpose — the `learn` tool, or a person editing
 *   the file. Consolidation never touches it.
 *
 *   `MEMORY.md` holds what a background pass concluded from reading sessions. It is rewritten
 *   wholesale, which is only safe because the deliberate half lives elsewhere.
