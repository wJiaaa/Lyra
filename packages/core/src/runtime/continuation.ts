/**
 * Carrying on when a turn stops before the work does.
 *
 * Two different endings, one answer. A turn is capped so that one runaway cannot spin forever, and
 * a big piece of work legitimately exceeds that cap — a full-stack project reaches it around the
 * point the frontend starts. And a turn can lose its connection outright, after twenty minutes of
 * reading files and running tools.
 *
 * What used to happen in both cases was that the run stopped and waited for someone to press
 * "continue", which is exactly the human intervention an unattended run exists to avoid. The
 * connection case was worse than the cap: `retryAttempts` covers the request, so once those are
 * spent the turn is over — and the work it had done, being already in the transcript, was thrown
 * away not because it was lost but because nobody asked for it back.
 *
 * So it starts another turn. That is all "continuing from where it stopped" needs to be: the
 * history is the progress, every finished reply and tool result is already committed to it, and a
 * fresh turn over that history resumes at the next step rather than the first one. Nothing is
 * replayed and nothing is re-run.
 *
 * Bounded in both cases. Bounded tightly for the connection, because nothing here can tell a
 * network blip from an outage except by trying.
 *
 * The cap used to be bounded loosely, on the reasoning that the two ways a run can be genuinely
 * stuck are caught elsewhere: repetition ends a turn with `stalled`, and a model that has stopped
 * calling tools is nudged a few times and then left alone. **That reasoning was wrong, and it cost
 * five hours and $10.72 to find out.**
 *
 * Measured on the session that did it (2026-09-15, `86ff1d52`): 396 rounds over 5.32 hours,
 * 36.9M tokens — and of the 396 tool calls, **384 had distinct fingerprints**. The repetition watch
 * never fired once, and it was right not to: nothing repeated. A model reading a different file and
 * grepping a different word every round is not looping by any measure that watch can take, and it
 * can do that until the money runs out. The safety net named above simply has no thread across this
 * particular hole.
 *
 * So the cap now checks the one thing that actually distinguishes a long task from a stuck one:
 * whether the last two hundred rounds finished anything. See `STALLED_CONTINUATIONS`.
 *
 * A policy, not a mechanism — hence a module of its own, and a set of questions it asks rather than
 * a session it reaches into.

 * always yes and the loop is unbounded in everything except the backstop above.
 *
 * "Did anything get *done*?" is the question that separates the two cases the old comment ran
 * together. A real long task finishes items as it goes: the frontend half of a full-stack build
 * reaches the cap having ticked several boxes. A stuck one reaches it having ticked none — which is
 * exactly what the 2026-09-15 session did, twice over, while its plan sat at 0 of 4.
 *
 * One is allowed, not zero, because a single item can legitimately be larger than two hundred
 * rounds and the first stretch of a hard task is often all reading. Two in a row is four hundred
 * rounds with nothing to show, and at that point the useful thing to do is stop and let a person
