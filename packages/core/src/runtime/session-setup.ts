 * the session because it is a pure "read the world and report what is there" step — which is what
 * makes it possible to re-run after settings change without touching anything else.
 *
 * Precedence used to be the theme here, and now it is not. Which directories are read and who wins
 * a name collision belong to `capability/`, where the rule is written once instead of once per
 * loader — five copies of "most specific wins" had drifted apart in exactly the ways you would
 * expect, and one of them had the comparison backwards. What is left in this file is assembly.
