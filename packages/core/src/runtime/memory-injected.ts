/**
 * When each memory was last put in front of the model.
 *
 * A memory that has not been injected for three months is one whose trigger is broken or whose
 * subject is gone — the plan (12 §7) calls this the easily-missed field, and it is the only one
 * on the page that says whether a memory is doing anything. Here everything is injected on
 * every turn, so the field mostly separates "reaching the model" from "added after the last
 * session" or "switched off"; that is still the question it answers.
 *
 * Kept beside the memory, never inside it. `memory.json` and `learned.md` are content that a
 * person edits and adds to; a timestamp written into them on every turn would race a hand-added
 * entry (read-modify-write of the whole file) or dirty a hand-edited markdown. Losing a write
 * here loses a timestamp. Losing a write there loses a memory.
 *
 * Throttled per file, because a turn is the hot path and the file is the same for a minute.
