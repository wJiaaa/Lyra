 * That is deliberate — the part of a sandbox you can get wrong silently is the part that decides
 * which paths are writable, and a pure function is the part you can actually test. The impure half
 * (probing a runner, wrapping an argv) lives in `local.ts`.
 *
 * The mode governs **file effects only**, and the network is a second, independent axis. They are
 * not folded into one setting because they are not ordered the same way: a project the agent may
 * write to is also a project it usually needs `pnpm install` for, so "more file access" does not
 * imply "more network" or the reverse. Keeping them separate is what lets `workspace-write` with
 * the network denied be a coherent answer — the mode people actually want when they are running
 * something they have not read.
 *
 * Process visibility is still not in the vocabulary.
