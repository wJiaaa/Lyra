/**
 * Which confinement this machine can actually provide, decided by trying it.
 *
 * Selection is by platform first: macOS has Seatbelt; Linux has `bwrap` and, where that cannot run,
 * Landlock; Windows has a restricted token. Then the candidate is *probed* — really spawned, with
 * the real profile, around a command that does nothing — because the question is not "is the
 * binary there" but "does the kernel accept what we are about to ask it". `sandbox-exec` exists on
 * every macOS and can still refuse a profile; `bwrap` is often installed without the user
 * namespaces it needs.
 *
 * And when the answer is no, it is no. A backend that cannot confine reports that it cannot, and
 * the caller's choice is to run unconfined *knowingly* or not to run. The one thing that must never
 * happen is the quiet fallback: returning the original argv from a function whose whole purpose was
 * to wrap it, so a command runs with full access under a UI that says it is sandboxed.
 *
 * Which is exactly why every supported platform has to have a backend that works. The Windows
 * runner never started (see `runner-entry.ts`), and a stock Ubuntu has no usable `bwrap` (see
 * `linux/landlock.ts`) — on both, "fail closed" meant the default permission mode ran nothing.
