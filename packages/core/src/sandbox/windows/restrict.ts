/**
 * Building the restricted token, and granting the one directory it may write to.
 *
 * The shape of the thing: a `WRITE_RESTRICTED` token carries a second list of SIDs, and every
 * write it attempts must be granted by the object's DACL *and* by something in that list. Take the
 * list down to identities nobody grants anything to, then put a grant for one made-up identity on
 * one directory, and that directory is the only place the process can write.
 *
 * The made-up identity is a capability SID derived from the workspace path (`identity.ts`). It
 * exists nowhere in Windows' own records — its entire meaning is the ACE we put on the directory,
 * which is exactly the property wanted: it grants precisely one thing and cannot be borrowed.
 *
 * Everything here fails closed. A token that could not be restricted is not a token to spawn with,
 * so every failure throws and the caller never gets a handle.

/**
 * Add full-access ACEs to the token's *default* DACL, for the SIDs given.
 *
 * Subtle and necessary. The default DACL is what every new object the process creates gets when it
 * does not supply one of its own — its own process and thread objects, and the anonymous pipes Node
 * makes for a child's stdio. A write-restricted token passes an access check only when *both* checks
 * pass: the ordinary one, against the token's groups, and the second, against its restricting SIDs.
 * So an entry here has to name a SID that each check accepts.
 *
 * Only the logon SID is in both lists, and that is why it is always here. The capability SID alone —
 * which this used to add under `workspace-write` — satisfies the second check and never the first: it
 * is not one of the token's groups. That went unnoticed wherever the inherited default DACL already
 * granted the user, and failed wherever it did not. An elevated administrator's names Administrators
 * and SYSTEM — Administrators being deny-only once the token is filtered — so a command could not
 * open its own process object and died in loader initialisation, `0xC0000142`, before its first
 * instruction: every confined command, for anyone running Plume as administrator. It showed in CI only
 * under a PowerShell step; Git Bash rewrites its own default DACL to grant the user, and everything
 * started beneath it inherits that.
 *
 * Never Everyone, which would open every object the command creates to every account on the machine;
 * the logon SID reaches no further than this sign-in. Not inheritable: a default DACL is not a
 * container's, and the entries have nothing to be inherited by.
