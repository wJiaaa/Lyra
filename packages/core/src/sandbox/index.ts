/**
 * Which sandbox the tools use.
 *
 * Bound by the host at boot, exactly as the model and tool registries are. Everything that runs a
 * command asks here rather than importing a spawn, so replacing the sandbox is one line in a plugin
 * instead of a search through the tools.
 *
 * The fallback matters: core is used by tests and by the CLI, neither of which builds a kernel, and
 * a seam that only works once a plugin has been loaded is a seam that breaks the simple cases.
