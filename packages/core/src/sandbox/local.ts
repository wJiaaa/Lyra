/**

 * to read past. `TERM=dumb` is what tells most programs both at once.
 *
 * The rest are the other ways a command waits for a person who is not there:
 *
 * - `GIT_EDITOR=true`: `git merge`, `git commit --amend` and `git rebase --continue` open an editor
 *   for the message. With `core.editor = code --wait` that was a VS Code window appearing and the
 *   command waiting on it until the timeout killed it. `true` accepts the message git prepared.
 * - `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`: an HTTPS remote without a credential fails at once instead of asking.
 * - `AWS_PAGER`: the AWS CLI pipes every result through `less` unless told not to.
 * - `DEBIAN_FRONTEND`: `apt` asks its questions on a terminal that does not exist.
 * - `PYTHONIOENCODING`: Python writes to a pipe in the locale's code page, which on a Chinese
 *   Windows is GBK — and arrives here as mojibake.
