/**
 * Confining a command's writes on Linux with Landlock — no namespaces, no privileges, no helper.
 *
 * `bwrap` was the only Linux backend, and on the machines people actually use it is usually not
 * there to use. Measured on a stock Ubuntu 24.04 (kernel 6.8): no `bwrap` installed, and
 * `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`, which denies the user namespace `bwrap` needs even
 * where it is installed. The sandbox is fail-closed by design, so on that machine the default
 * permission mode refused every command with "no sandbox backend" — the most common Linux desktop,
 * and nothing ran.
 *
 * Landlock is in the kernel's default LSM list on Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian, and an unprivileged
 * process may apply it to itself. It answers the question this sandbox asks — which directories
 * may be written — and the answer is inherited by every child and cannot be dropped. So this file
 * is a runner in the same shape as the Windows one: the backend spawns it in front of the shell,
 * it restricts itself, starts the command with the same stdio, and exits with the command's status.
 *
 * What it governs: every write-type filesystem right the running kernel knows (`handled`), allowed
 * back only beneath the writable roots the policy names. Reads and execution are not handled, and
 * so are unrestricted — the same promise Seatbelt's `(deny file-write*)` makes. Device files stay
 * writable in every mode (`/dev/null` above all, which a shell cannot run without), and creating or
 * deleting nodes in `/dev` does not.
