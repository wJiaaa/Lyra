/**
 * The program a confined command is run through, where the confinement is a process of our own.
 *
 * macOS and Linux-with-bwrap put somebody else's program in front of the command. Windows (a
 * restricted token) and Linux-with-Landlock have no such program, so this is it: the backend
 * spawns this file under the app's own runtime, with the marker flag, and it does the platform's
 * work and becomes the command's exit status.
 *
 * A file of its own because of how it has to be started. The runner used to be the app itself —
 * `Plume.exe --plume-sandbox-runner …` with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` — and in that mode Electron is
 * Node, which reads the first argument as one of its own options: `bad option:
 * --plume-sandbox-runner`, exit 9, every time. The probe failed, the backend reported no sandbox,
 * and on Windows the default permission mode refused every command. Node mode needs a script
 * before any flag, and this is the script. The desktop build emits it as `sandbox-runner.js`
 * beside the main bundle; from source it runs as TypeScript.
