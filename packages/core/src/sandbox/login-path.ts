/**
 * The environment a command should run with, on a machine where the app was launched from an icon.
 *
 * A GUI-launched app on macOS inherits `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` from launchd and nothing
 * else. `git` and `python3` live there; `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `corepack` and `bun`
 * do not. Neither does anything a version manager installs — fnm, nvm, volta, asdf all put their
 * shims somewhere under `$HOME` and announce them from a shell startup file.
 *
 * Spawning through `$SHELL -c` does not recover them. That is a non-interactive, non-login shell:
 * zsh reads `~/.zshenv` and stops, so the `export PATH=…` that almost everybody keeps in `~/.zshrc`
 * never runs. The command then fails with `command not found` for a tool the user can run in their
 * own terminal without thinking about it, which reads as the app being broken rather than as an
 * environment that was never assembled.
 *
 * This was not hypothetical. In one user's session history `pnpm` was not found 50 times, `node` 25
 * and `corkscrew` 23 — the last of those being an ssh `ProxyCommand`, so every SSH git operation
 * failed too. In the same history, 15% of all commands the model wrote began by exporting `PATH`
 * itself: it had learned to patch around this one call at a time.
 *
 * `PATH` was the loudest symptom of a wider gap: everything else those startup files export was
 * missing too. `https_proxy` — without which, behind the proxies common in China, `git push`, `npm
 * install` and `curl` time out while the same commands work in the user's terminal — and
 * `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` for 1Password's or another agent, `LANG`, `JAVA_HOME`, `GOPATH`. So the shell is
 * asked once for its whole environment, the way a terminal would start it, and the answer is kept.
 *
 * On Linux the same launch looks different, which is why "is this a GUI launch" is no longer read
 * off `PATH`: a desktop session hands its apps `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/games` and `/snap/bin` as
 * well as the system four, so that test said "a shell built this" and never asked — and nvm's node,
 * configured in `~/.bashrc` like everywhere else, was `command not found` in every session.
 *
 * `electron/git-exec.ts` solved the `PATH` half for the built-in git panel by appending a list of
 * likely directories. That list is the fallback here, because a list cannot know where fnm put
 * tonight's node, and asking the shell can.
