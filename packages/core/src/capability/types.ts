/**
 * What a capability is, where one comes from, and what happens when two of them collide.
 *
 * Before this file, adding a place to look for skills meant a new loop, a new precedence rule and
 * a new diagnostic type, written next to the four that already existed and agreeing with them only
 * by hand. Five such loops had drifted apart in exactly the ways you would expect: one reported
 * shadowing, three did it silently; two deduplicated case-sensitively and one did not; the
 * agent loader put built-ins first, which meant a custom definition of the same name could never
 * win, and nothing anywhere said so.
 *
 * The shapes here exist so that a source is a value rather than a code path.
 */

/**
 * The kinds of thing a project can contribute.
 *
 * The list is closed on purpose. A capability is a promise that something will be found, merged
 * and shadowed a particular way, and an open string type turns a typo into a capability that is
