/**
 * The registry: run every provider, merge what they found, and be able to say why.
 *
 * The whole of the interesting behaviour is in `load`, and it is short because the hard parts are
 * decisions rather than code:
 *
 *   A provider that throws must not take the others down. Discovery walks other people's
 *   directories, and one of them will eventually be a broken symlink or a file the user cannot
 *   read. The failure becomes a diagnostic and the rest of the load proceeds.
 *
 *   Dropping an item and suppressing one are different operations. Both remove it from the
 *   result; only one lets a lower-priority item of the same name take its place. Conflating them
 *   is how switching off a project skill silently promotes your personal one.
 *
 *   Losers are kept. A settings page that can only show what won cannot answer the question people
 *   actually ask, which is why the thing they wrote is not running.
