/**
 * Where secrets are kept, and why not in the OS keychain.
 *
 * The obvious place is `safeStorage` — the macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, a Linux keyring — and
 * that is where the forge tokens used to live. It cost more than it bought, for one reason that is
 * specific to how this app is shipped: the macOS builds are ad-hoc signed, so the app's designated
 * requirement is a hash of its own executable:
 *
 *     # designated => cdhash H"a2a46d81ea171721f80958eff53316b3e3fca8c9"
 *
 * A keychain entry's access control names that requirement. Every release is a new build, so every
 * release has a new hash, so every release is — as far as macOS is concerned — a different
 * application asking for someone else's secrets. What that looked like was signing in to GitHub
 * again after every update, and a keychain prompt to go with it. Windows and Linux are unaffected
 * (DPAPI keys off the user account, keyrings off the application name), so this was macOS paying
 * for a guarantee the other two got for free.
 *
 * The honest trade this makes instead:
 *
 * - **What it protects against.** A secret in `settings.json` travels: that file is synced, copied
 *   between machines, and pasted into bug reports, and it was world-readable at 0644 with the API
 *   keys in it. Nothing here is in a file that gets shared, and all of it is 0600.
 * - **What it does not.** The key sits next to the ciphertext. Anything that can read your home
 *   directory can read both. This is a smaller claim than the keychain's, and the settings page
 *   says so rather than implying otherwise.
 *
 * If this app is ever signed with a Developer ID the keychain becomes stable and worth returning
 * to. That is a one-line change to where `key()` gets its bytes; the format below does not care.
