/**
 * Settings that can differ per repository, without changing them back by hand every time.
 *
 * One flat global file means working on two projects with different needs — a cheap model and
 * strict approval here, a strong model and loose approval there — is a manual edit on every
 * switch. And the failure is not the editing: it is forgetting to edit back, which makes the next
 * project's session run under the previous project's rules with nothing on screen saying so.
 *
 * 两层，全局在下、项目在上：`~/.plume/settings.json` → `<cwd>/.plume/config.json`。
 *
 * 计划里画的是五层（内置默认 → 全局 → 项目 → 一次性 → 运行时），这里也曾经有一个
 * `resolveLayers` 按那五层合并、并记录每个键来自哪一层。**而实际接线走的是两层**——会话拿到
 * 全局那份、叠上项目那份，一次性和运行时那两层没有入口，「哪个键来自哪个文件」也没有界面。
 *
 * 所以那个函数删掉了：一个更通用、而没有任何调用者的 API，比现在这两层还危险——
 * 下一个人会以为那才是该走的路。真需要五层的时候，git 历史里有。
 *
 * 剩下的两个决定还是原来那两个：怎么合并，以及项目文件**不**许带什么。
