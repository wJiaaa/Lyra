/**
 * What "who uses this symbol" means, and how sure we are about the answer.
 *
 * The whole reason this layer exists is one failure that does not announce itself. `grep` cannot
 * see an aliased import — `import { parse as p }` and then `p(...)` at the call site — and it
 * cannot follow a re-export chain. So a rename done with text tools finds most of the callsites,
 * misses some, and looks finished. The compiler catches it, or the runtime does.
 *
 * Which is why `confidence` is on every result rather than implied. "Found 6 places" and "text
 * search found 6 places, which may be missing aliased imports" are different pieces of information
 * to act on: the second one is a reason to check.
