/**
 * TypeScript, through the `tsserver` binary that is already in `node_modules`.
 *
 * Three ways to reach TypeScript's understanding of a program, and the choice between them is
 * about where the cost lands:
 *
 *   `typescript-language-server` speaks standard LSP, and is a dependency to install. `core` has
 *   four of those and the restraint is deliberate.
 *
 *   The `LanguageService` API needs no process and no protocol, and builds the program *inside
 *   this process*. On a large repository that is seconds of blocking work and hundreds of
 *   megabytes, in the process drawing the UI.
 *
 *   `tsserver` is a subprocess with a private protocol. No new dependency, no risk to the window,
 *   and one adapter layer to write — this file. It is the only non-standard adapter we take on;
 *   every other language goes through standard LSP.
 *
 * The protocol is line-delimited JSON, not LSP's `Content-Length` framing, and its own request
 * names. Both are why this is a file rather than a config entry.
