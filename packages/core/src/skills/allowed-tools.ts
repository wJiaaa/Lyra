 * `WebFetch`), sometimes narrowed by a permission pattern (`Bash(git add *)`). The loader used to
 * accept only a list and compared its names exactly against ours, which are lowercase. A string
 * was dropped, so the skill ran with every tool; a list matched nothing, so it ran with none but
 * `skill`. Neither said a word.
 *
 * A name that reads as none of our tools is kept as written and reported, not dropped. Enforcement
 * treats an empty list as no restriction, so dropping a skill's only names would lift the very
 * restriction it asked for; a name kept as written matches no tool, and the restriction stands.
