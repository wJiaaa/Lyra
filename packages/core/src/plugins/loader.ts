/**
 * Plugins, and the MCP servers that were being mistaken for them.
 *
 * A plugin is a bundle of *skills*: a manifest plus a `skills/` directory, where each skill may
 * carry its own `scripts/`, `assets/` and sub-agent definitions. That is the whole of it.
 *
 * It used to also carry MCP servers, on the reasoning that a bundle is just packaging and may as
 * well ship both. What that produced, in practice, was a catalogue of nine "plugins" of which
 * seven were a single `.mcp.json` and no skills at all — Context7, Filesystem, Playwright: MCP
 * servers, listed as plugins, installed as plugins, and then invisible on the MCP settings page
 * because that page reads `settings.mcpServers` and these had gone somewhere else entirely. The
 * same server could be configured twice, from two places, with two switches that could not see
 * each other.
 *
 * So the rule is now: **what a directory contains decides what it is.** Skills make it a plugin.
 * Only a `.mcp.json` makes it an MCP server that happens to have arrived in a git repository —
 * `McpBundle` below — and installing one of those writes its servers into settings, where every
 * other MCP server already lives. A directory holding both is loaded as a plugin and says so in
 * a diagnostic; nothing in the wild does this, and the alternative is the ambiguity we just left.
 *
 * Layout:
 *
 *   my-plugin/
 *     .lyra-plugin/plugin.json   (or ./plugin.json)
 *     skills/<name>/SKILL.md
 *     skills/<name>/scripts/…
 *
 *   my-mcp-server/
 *     .lyra-plugin/plugin.json   (for its name, icon and description)
 *     .mcp.json

/**
 * Resolve a manifest-supplied relative path, refusing anything that escapes the plugin.

 * backslash — so every containment check answered "escaped", every `.mcp.json` was refused, and
 * every MCP bundle was misfiled as a plugin. The failure is only visible on Windows, which is
 * exactly the kind of thing a `/` in a path check hides.
