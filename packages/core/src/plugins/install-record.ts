 * renderer. The two facts being compared meet there and nowhere else: what is on disk comes from
 * the main process's scan, what is on offer comes from a registry the window fetched itself. A
 * renderer that imported the reading half would pull `node:fs` into a browser bundle and blank the
 * window on the first import — see the note in AGENTS.md about sub-entries.
 *
 * So: no imports, no bindings, nothing but a type and a comparison.

/**

 *
 * Three comparisons, in descending order of how much they can be trusted, and **silence when none
 * of them applies**. Claiming an update that is not there is worse than missing one: it puts a
 * badge on a card that pressing the button beside it cannot clear, because there was nothing to
 * install and the next scan will say the same thing again.
 *
 *   - `commit` — resolved by the platform against the upstream ref at build time. If both sides
 *     have one and they differ, something upstream genuinely moved.
 *   - `sha256` — of the built archive. It identifies a build rather than a content, since gzip
 *     output is runtime-dependent, so it can say "not the same build" and never "same content".
 *   - `version` — last, because most of this catalogue has no real one. `waza` publishes
 *     `0.0.0-30bf9a1`, derived from a commit, and `anthropic-skills` publishes `0.0.0`: the first
 *     differs whenever the commit moves and the second never differs at all.
 *
 * Compared for inequality only, never for order. `2026.7.4` and `0.3.7` are both live in this
 * catalogue and there is no ordering that reads both correctly — and "different" is the whole
 * question anyway, since a registry serving an older build is still serving what it now offers.
