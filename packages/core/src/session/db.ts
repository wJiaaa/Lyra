 * The API is synchronous, and that is load-bearing. A transaction here never spans an `await`, so
 * nothing else in this process can interleave with it — which is what lets the store drop the
 * per-session write queues the JSONL files needed. Keep it that way: **a transaction only reads and
 * writes the database**. No file I/O, no network, no waiting on anything, because every session in
 * every process queues on the same write lock.
