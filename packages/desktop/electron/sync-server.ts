/**
 * Sync server.
 *
 * The desktop app is the source of truth: it owns the filesystem, the shell and the MCP
 * processes. The phone is a thin client that replays the same session log and drives the same
 * `AgentSession`, so a turn started on the desktop can be watched and steered from the phone
 * and vice versa.
 *
 * Transport: the current mobile bridge uses one WebSocket for RPC and live events; HTTP remains
 * for renderer assets, pairing probes and older clients. Auth is a bearer token the user pairs
 * once; the server only listens on the LAN unless the user adds a reverse proxy or relay.
