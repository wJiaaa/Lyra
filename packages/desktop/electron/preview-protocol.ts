	 * answering with that space no matter what space we offer.
	 *
	 * For that second case the height rules are lifted and the content is left to compose itself.

	 * taller, and now it really does overflow — the bar earns its own existence, and every preview
	 * ends up with a grey rail down one side that nothing asked for.
	 *
	 * Removing it from the layout ends the loop: an overlay scrollbar takes no width, so measuring
	 * and displaying agree.
	 *
	 * Hiding the rail was not enough on its own, though. A page left a pixel over its allowance
	 * still scrolls — it wobbles under the wheel, and worse, it swallows the gesture, so scrolling
	 * with the pointer over a preview stops moving the conversation behind it. Inside the card the
	 * page therefore does not scroll at all: it was measured to fit, and anything that genuinely
	 * needs more room has the side panel, where scrolling is what you came for. `ly-inline` is set
	 * by the card and by nothing else, so the same file scrolls normally when opened there.
