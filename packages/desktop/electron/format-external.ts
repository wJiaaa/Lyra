/**
 * The formatters that have to be the real thing.
 *
 * Prettier can be taught to print Go, and the result is wrong — not incorrect code, but code no
 * Go programmer would accept, because `gofmt` is not a style preference in that language, it is
 * the style. The same holds for `rustfmt`, and for Python where a project that has settled on
 * `black` or `ruff` expects its exact output. So these run against the actual binary on the
 * machine, and when there is no binary the answer is to say so rather than to approximate it.
 *
 * All of them read stdin and write stdout, which is what makes this one function instead of six:
 * no temporary files, nothing touched on disk, and formatting an unsaved buffer works the same as
 * formatting a saved one.
