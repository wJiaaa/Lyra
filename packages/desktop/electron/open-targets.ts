/**
 * What 「用什么打开」 can mean on this machine.
 *
 * Two things used to be conflated here. The setting stored an application's macOS display name and
 * the handler ran `open -a` with it, which made the whole feature macOS-only — on Windows and Linux
 * every choice fell through to `shell.openPath`, so picking an editor did nothing and the list
 * still offered Finder, Ghostty and Xcode. And 「Finder」 was treated as an application to open the
 * file *with*, so choosing it handed the file to the Finder to launch rather than showing you where
 * it lives, which is the only thing anyone means by it.
 *
 * So a target is now one of three kinds, and the list is what this machine actually has:
 *
 *   reveal    show the file where it lives, in whatever this platform calls its file manager
 *   app       open the file with an application
 *   terminal  open a shell in the file's directory — never *at* the file, which would run it
 *
 * Ids are stable and platform-neutral (`vscode`, not `Visual Studio Code`), because settings sync
 * between machines: a choice made on a Mac has to still mean something on a PC.
