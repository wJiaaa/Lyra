/**
 * Dialling out to a relay, for the case where nothing can dial in.
 *
 * The sync server waits to be connected to, which works on a shared network and nowhere else. A
 * phone on mobile data and a desktop behind a home router have no route between them and no port
 * either end can open. A relay solves it by having *both* sides dial out — an outbound connection
 * needs no forwarding — and copying bytes between the two.
 *
 * So this is the desktop's outbound half. It connects, announces which room it wants, and from then
 * on the socket behaves exactly like a phone that connected directly: the same frames, answered by
 * the same code. That symmetry is the point — `sync-server.ts` adds it to `clients` and never has
 * to know which kind of connection it is holding.
 *
 * The room is the SHA-256 of the pairing token. The token itself never reaches the relay, so a
 * relay can route the devices without receiving the token. The room remains a bearer capability:
 * its holder and the relay operator can inject session frames, so the relay must be trusted.
