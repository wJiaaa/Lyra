/**
 * The status bar item: reaching the app without going through its window.
 *
 * What it is for is starting something. An agent runs for minutes at a time, so the window spends
 * most of its life closed or behind something else, and "I want to ask it one thing" should not
 * begin with finding a window. What the menu offers is in `tray-menu.ts`, which is the same list
 * on every platform; this file is how it is raised, which is not.
 *
 * **How the menu opens.** macOS attaches it to the right button only: `setContextMenu` there takes
 * the click event entirely, so the item would stop toggling the window and only ever open a menu.
 * Windows and Linux hand the menu to the system with `setContextMenu` and keep raising `click` for
 * the left button — which is both the platform convention and the only thing that reliably works,
 * since a `right-click` handler competes with the system's own handling of that button. That was
 * the bug: the menu existed and could not be opened.
 *
 * Icon handling differs by platform in a way that is not cosmetic either:
 *
 *   - macOS gets a template image, which the system fills with the menu bar's own foreground
 *     colour. That is the only correct answer there, because the menu bar inverts under a dark
 *     wallpaper, under a pulled-down menu and under an active-app highlight — a fixed bitmap is
 *     wrong in at least one of those, whichever one it is drawn for.
 *   - Windows and Linux have no equivalent, and their notification areas are full of colour
 *     already, so they get the coloured P — one bitmap per display scaling, no theme switching.
 *
 * Both come out of `scripts/make-tray-icons.mjs`, from the same P mark.
