/**
 * Gitee, which has no way to ask "what is waiting on me".
 *
 * Every other host here answers that in one request. Gitee's API is per-repository all the way
 * down — its published surface has no cross-repository pull request search, and its only global
 * endpoints are for issues — so the list is built the only way it can be: take the repositories
 * this account touched most recently, ask each one for its open pull requests, and sort out who
 * they belong to here.
 *
 * That is a real cost and it is spent carefully. The repository list is cached, the scan is capped
 * at the ones actually being worked in, and the requests are pooled rather than fired at once —
 * because the failure mode of getting this wrong is not slowness, it is being rate-limited by the
 * host and showing an empty list.
 *
 * Two buckets rather than three: Gitee models a reviewer as an assignee or a tester, and has no
 * notion of "pull requests I have already reviewed". Inventing one would mean guessing.
