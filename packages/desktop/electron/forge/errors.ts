 * nobody has seen before, and a `fetch` that cannot reach a host says `ENOTFOUND` and nothing else.
 * Left alone, all of that reaches a person as a line of English punctuation.
 *
 * The rule is that a message names the thing to do next, and says which account it is about when
 * there is more than one. Everything here is pure — no network, no Electron — because a message
 * about a failure is exactly the code you cannot test by causing the failure.
