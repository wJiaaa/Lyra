/**
 * What a phone is allowed to change about the desktop's settings.
 *
 * `settings.save` used to take whatever arrived and write it to disk as the complete settings. That
 * is wrong twice over.
 *
 * The first is safety. `hooks` and `scheduledTasks` are lists of shell commands the desktop runs on
 * its own, and `mcpServers` is a list of processes it launches — so the pairing token, which lives
 * in a phone that can be lost, was enough to run anything on the machine. The allowlist in
 * `sync-rpc.ts` is careful to leave out every method that reaches the shell, and this one method
 * quietly handed back the same reach through the back door.
 *
 * The second is that a partial object replaced a complete one. The phone sends what it has; if the
 * two ends are not the same version, or a field was dropped in transit, the fields it did not send
 * are gone from disk. That is how a light theme with nothing else in it reached the renderer and
 * took the window down with `hex.trim` — a settings object with only `theme` in its `appearance`.
 *
 * Both are answered the same way: start from what the desktop currently has and lay only the
 * permitted fields over it. The result is always complete, and never contains anything a phone had
 * no business setting.

 * **`permissionMode` 是这条规则明说的例外，写在这里免得有人照着上一句做判断。** 把它设成 `full`
 * 之后审批全部放行、沙箱变 `danger-full-access`，所以它确实「把机器交了出去」——而这是想要的：
 * 在手机上批准本来就是这个功能存在的理由，一个批得了单次、改不了模式的手机是半个功能。代价写在

 *
 *   appearance         the theme, which is the whole point of syncing it
 *   defaultModelId     which model a new conversation uses
 *   favoriteModelIds   the shortlist in the model menu
 *   thinking           reasoning depth, per the picker in the composer
 *   lastThinking       where that picker was left, so the two ends agree on it
 *   permissionMode     whether a tool call waits for approval — approving from a phone is most of
 *                      why this feature exists, and the mode has to be reachable from there too
 *   alwaysAllow        what was approved for good, which is written by approving on the phone
 *   personalization    how the agent addresses you
 *   disabledPlugins    switching a plugin off, which runs nothing by itself
 *   pinnedSessionIds   pinning a conversation
 *   unreadSessionIds   which conversations still have something unread, cleared by opening one
 *   commitLanguage     the language commit messages are written in
	 *   uiLocale           the language Plume itself uses
 *   retryPolicy        how a failed request is retried
 *   editor             which editor "open in" uses on the *desktop* — harmless, and the setting
 *                      lives on the page the phone can see
 *
 * Deliberately absent, each because setting it runs code or moves the ground under the connection:
 * `hooks`, `scheduledTasks`, `mcpServers`, `formatting`, `worktrees`, `screenshot`, `projects`,
 * `sync`, `pluginRegistries`, `skillRegistries`, `allowedHosts`, `searchProvider`,
 * `searchApiKeys`, `providers`, `version`, `updateCheckIntervalHours`.
 *
 * `providers` is the one that looks like it belongs and does not: it carries API keys, and a phone
 * that could write them could also read back what it wrote. Choosing among the models already
 * configured is `defaultModelId`, which is here.
