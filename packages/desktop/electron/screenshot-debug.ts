/**
 * A written record of one capture, from the shortcut to the last window operation.
 *
 * Everything this file exists to answer is a question about *timing and actual values* on someone
 * else's machine: which branch ran, what the display really measures, what size the snapshot came
 * back at, when the window was shown relative to when it was activated. None of that can be
 * inferred from the source — the same code takes different paths depending on what was frontmost —
 * and none of it survives a screen recording, which shows the symptom and not the cause.
 *
 * Written to `screenshot-debug.log` in the app's own directory, appended, one line per event with a
 * millisecond stamp relative to the start of the capture. Cheap enough to leave on: a capture
 * produces a couple of dozen lines, about 2KB, and the file starts over once it passes `LOG_LIMIT`.
