/**
 * Finding a program on PATH the way the platform itself would, without running a program to ask.
 *
 * This used to be done three ways: `which`/`where` in `open-targets.ts`, a hand-rolled loop in
 * the (since removed) formatter, and not at all in the terminal. Each had its own gap. `which` is not
 * installed on a minimal Arch system, so no editor or terminal was ever offered there. The loop
 * joined `gofmt` onto each directory and asked whether that file existed — on Windows it is
 * `gofmt.exe`, so every formatter read as 「未安装」 however it had been installed.
 *
 * No Electron and no shell here, and the platform is a parameter: the Windows rules are the ones
 * that break, and they have to be checkable on the machines the tests actually run on.
