/**
 * The phone link's framing: large messages as acknowledged binary parts, small ones as they were.
 *
 * Until wire 2 every message was one WebSocket frame, and that shape broke in four places at once
 * once a conversation or an attachment got large: the relay refused frames over 8 MiB by closing the
 * link; one 20 MB transcript held every small message (a pong, a streamed token) behind it for as
 * long as the phone's network took to carry it, so the phone's 5-second heartbeat declared the link
 * dead mid-transfer; nothing bounded how much sat in the relay or in socket buffers; and each hop
 * held the whole message at once. See docs/adr/0037-sync-link-streams-large-data.md.
 *
 * Wire 2 keeps text frames for everything small and adds, both ways:
 *
 *   {"type":"stream","s":7,"size":N,"z":1?,"for":"r12"?,"label":"sessions.open"?}   announce
 *   binary [kind u8][sid u32][offset f64][bytes]                                      parts
 *   {"type":"ack","s":7,"n":bytesReceived}                                           per part
 *
 * A sender keeps at most `WINDOW_BYTES` unacknowledged, so a slow receiver slows the sender instead
 * of filling whatever sits between them — including an old relay that never learned backpressure.
 * Uploads (kind 2) share the framing and the acks; see `sync-uploads.ts`.
 *
 * Negotiated, never assumed: the desktop's hello says `wire: 2`, the phone answers
 * `{"type":"wire","version":2}`, and until that answer arrives this sends exactly what it always
 * did. An old phone never answers, so it never sees a binary frame.
