/**
 * The embedded terminal.
 *
 * A pty per project directory, and — the part worth reading — one that outlives the pane showing
 * it. The pane comes and goes constantly: closing it, switching to a conversation whose layout
 * does not include it, or making another pane full screen all unmount it. Tying the shell's life
 * to the pane meant every one of those killed it, so coming back gave you a new shell in the same
 * place: no history, no running process, no half-typed command. That reads as the terminal
 * restarting itself, and next to a real terminal emulator — where a window you are not looking at
 * keeps running — it reads as broken.
 *
 * So the renderer attaches and detaches, and only `kill` ends anything. Detaching keeps the shell
 * running and keeps recording what it writes, and the next attach replays that recording into the
 * fresh xterm, which redraws to exactly what was on screen before.
 *
 * Several can be running at once, which is what the pane's tabs are: `open` always starts a new
 * one, `listAll` reports every shell there is, and `attach` connects to one by id. A shell is
 * started *in* a directory but not filed under it — leaving a project does not hide a terminal that
 * is still running. `prewarm` starts the first one before anybody asks, which is what makes opening
 * the pane instant rather than a third of a second of empty rectangle.
 *
 * Windows are enumerated at delivery time: detached panes keep receiving output even while a
 * different app window has keyboard focus, and destroyed renderers never remain recipients.
 *
 * No Electron values are imported here, only types — so this can be driven straight from a test,
 * which is where every claim above is checked.
