/**
 * The overlay. One window, built once, hidden and shown for the rest of the process's life.
 *
 * It used to be built and destroyed per capture, and both of the transitions people complained
 * about were that construction cost, measured in `screenshot-debug.log`:
 *
 *   - Going in took 324ms from the shortcut to the window appearing, of which 177ms is the snapshot
 *     — a system cost — and 147ms was creating a window, loading a page and decoding a data URL.
 *     The picture shown is from the *start* of that, so anything that moved on screen in between
 *     jumps back when the overlay lands. That is the "stretch": not a scale, a step backwards in
 *     time, and the only fix is to make the gap small enough that nothing happens inside it.
 *   - Coming out, `app.hide()` on macOS is not synchronous. Destroying the overlay three
 *     milliseconds later uncovered the main window before the hide had landed, and the log has the
 *     window taking focus 6ms after the hide was asked for and losing it 19ms later — one and a
 *     bit frames of Plume on screen, which is the flash.
 *
 * A window that is never destroyed has neither cost: showing it is one call, and hiding it happens
 * under the cover of a hide that has already taken effect.

	 * pause arrives in 4ms, no slower than one taken seconds after the last capture. See
