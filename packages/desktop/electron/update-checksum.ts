/**
 * Proving the bytes we downloaded are the bytes that were released.
 *
 * Until now the only checks on an update were that its URL began with `https://github.com/` and
 * that the file came out the length the release said. Both are worth having and neither says
 * anything about *content*: the first trusts the origin, the second catches a truncated download.
 *
 * What neither catches is a file that arrives complete, from the right host, and is not what was
 * built — a proxy that rewrites payloads, a cache poisoned somewhere along the way, a mirror
 * someone stood up. And this is the one download in the application that ends in code being run:
 * the package is unpacked and launched.
 *
 * So the release publishes `SHA256SUMS` alongside its artifacts, and this reads it back. The digest
 * comes from the same release as the file, over the same TLS connection, which is not a chain of
 * trust that survives a compromised GitHub account — it is not meant to. It closes everything
 * between there and here.

 * because which one appears depends on the coreutils on the runner, and a release that fails to
 * verify over an asterisk would be a very annoying way to find that out.
