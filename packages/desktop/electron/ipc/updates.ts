/**
 * Finding out whether there is a newer release, fetching it, and handing it to the installer.
 *
 * The download happens here rather than in a browser. Sending someone to a web page to find the
 * right file among four is not an update mechanism, it is an apology for not having one — and the
 * page cannot know whether they are on Apple silicon or Intel, while this can.
 *
 * This said replacing the app in place was deliberately not done: the build is unsigned, and a
 * swap would grant an unsigned download the trust the user gave the installed copy. That stopped
 * being the arrangement when macOS got its staged swap (`install-update.ts`), and what made it
 * acceptable there holds for every platform now: nothing is put in place unless its bytes match the
 * release's own `SHA256SUMS` (`update-checksum.ts`), and a release without one is refused.
 *
 * So each platform ends with the step that actually finishes, taken when the person presses
 * 立即重启: macOS swaps the bundle; an AppImage is renamed over `$APPIMAGE`; a .deb is installed by
 * apt behind the system's own password prompt; Windows runs the NSIS installer and quits so it is
 * not killed by it. Details in `linux-install.ts` and `update-finish.ts`.
