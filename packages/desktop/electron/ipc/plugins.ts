/**
 * Installing and listing what the catalogue offers.

 * Two kinds of bundle, told apart by their contents rather than by where they sit: a plugin is a
 * directory of skills, and an MCP bundle is a directory whose whole content is a server
 * declaration. Installing the second writes its servers into settings, which is the only place a
 * session reads them from — that is what stops the same server existing twice, once here and once
 * on the MCP settings page, with two switches that could not see each other.
