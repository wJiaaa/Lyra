/**
 * What installing and uninstalling do to settings, as decisions rather than as handlers.
 *
 * Putting files on disk is only half of installing an MCP bundle. The other half is the rows it
 * writes into the settings file, because that — not the bundle's own `.mcp.json` — is where a
 * session reads its servers from. Get that half wrong and the symptoms are all quiet: a server the
 * user just uninstalled still listed and still connectable, a bundle installed twice with its
 * servers doubled up, or an upgrade that silently disconnects everything somebody had.
 *
 * Separate from `plugins.ts` because that file imports `electron`, which cannot be loaded by a test
 * runner. These are the parts worth being sure about and they need nothing but data, so they live
 * where they can be called directly. `plugins.ts` keeps the wiring and the ordering; this keeps the
 * rules.
 *
 * Every `settingsAfter*` returns the settings to save, or `null` for "nothing changed" — so a caller
 * never writes the settings file to record that it had nothing to record.

/**
 * The settings an install leaves behind, or null when it has nothing to say.
 *
 * Only an MCP bundle does: a plugin is inert until the loader picks it up, and a skill collection is
 * a directory of markdown. A bundle's servers arrive switched **off**, always. Installing is not the
 * same as trusting, and a server is a command that runs on this machine with this user's
 * permissions — the moment it becomes live should be one somebody chose.
 *
 * Re-installing replaces that bundle's rows rather than adding to them. Without that, installing
 * something twice leaves two copies of every server it declares, and switching "it" on switches on
 * whichever copy the list happened to hit first.
 *
 * Replacing keeps what was the user's: whether a server they already had is on, and the values they
 * filled in for it. An update rewrote every row as off, so the servers somebody had switched on
 * stopped the moment the bundle updated, with nothing saying why — and it would have done the same
 * to a key: the new declaration carries the placeholder, the row the person filled carries the key.
 * A server the new version brings for the first time still arrives off — that is the install
 * decision, made again only for what is new.
