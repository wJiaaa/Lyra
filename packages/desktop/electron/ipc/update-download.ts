/**
 * Fetching an update, in a way that survives the window that started it.
 *
 * What this replaces was a single `await` inside an IPC handler: the whole download lived in that
 * call's closure, reported progress to the one sender that asked for it, and existed only for as
 * long as nobody looked away. Three things followed from that, and all three were things people do:
 *
 *   - closing the dialog had to be forbidden mid-download, because there would have been nothing
 *     left to report to — so a 130MB fetch held the screen hostage
 *   - pausing was not expressible at all
 *   - a hundred megabytes in, anything that interrupted it started again from zero
 *
 * So the download is a thing with a state, and the state lives here rather than in a window. A
 * window subscribes to it and draws it; several windows draw the same one; a window that closes and
 * comes back asks what is happening and is told. The dialog becomes a view of a fact instead of the
 * only place the fact exists.
 *
 * Resuming is a `Range` request against the bytes already on disk, which is what makes pausing
 * worth offering rather than a politer word for cancelling. A server that ignores the header
 * answers 200 instead of 206, and then the file starts over — correct either way, and slower on the
 * servers that deserve it.
