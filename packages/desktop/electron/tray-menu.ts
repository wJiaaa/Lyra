 * What the status bar menu offers, as data.

 * in it is a product question with a short answer: the things worth doing when the window is not
 * in front of you. Everything here is reachable in one press from a cold app.
 *
 * The same list on every platform, deliberately. Where the platforms differ is how the menu is
 * *raised* — macOS attaches it to the right button and keeps the left one toggling the window,
 * Windows and Linux let the system raise it — and that is a convention each system owns. What is
 * in it is ours, and a menu that offered different things depending on which machine you sat at
 * would be two products.

 * nothing about views and a window that knows nothing about menus is the name. `open-session`
 * carries its subject in the name for the same reason — one channel, one shape.
