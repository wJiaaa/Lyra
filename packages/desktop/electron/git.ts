 * Whether this directory is inside a working tree — and if git would not say, why not.
 *
 * The catch used to swallow everything, and that is a different claim than it looks: `git` missing
 * from `PATH`, a directory that cannot be read, a repository git refuses to touch — all of them
 * came back as `false`, and the window said 「不是 Git 仓库，这个目录还没有版本控制」 about a
 * directory with a perfectly good `.git` in it. The one answer nobody could act on, because it
 * describes a state that is not the one they are in.
 *
 * Naming it in a log was not enough either: the log is somewhere the user cannot see, so the window
 * still showed the same wrong sentence with an 「初始化仓库」 button under it — offering to run
 * `git init` inside a repository. So the reason comes back with the answer and is put on screen.
 *
 * Three of these are worth telling apart, because the fix for each is different:
 *
 *     fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '…'   — a checkout owned by another user
 *     spawn git ENOENT                                          — no git on PATH at all
 *     fatal: not a git repository                               — git answering the question
