 * reaches the filesystem, the shell and the model keys. These rules exist so that surface only ever
 * hosts our own page, and so the pages we *do* host cannot ask for more than they need.
 *
 * Kept apart from `window-security.ts`, which attaches them to Electron, because what is worth
 * arguing with is the rule, and a rule that imports `electron` cannot be argued with outside
 * Electron. It matters more than usual here — every one of these functions exists to *refuse* something, and a
 * refusal that quietly stopped working looks exactly like one that was never reached.

 *
 * Without this rule one successful injection is enough: `location.href = "https://…"` loads a
 * remote page *into the window that holds the preload*, and that page then owns `window.lyra`.
