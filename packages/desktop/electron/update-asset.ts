/**
 * The one file this machine can install, or null.
 *
 * macOS takes the zip, not the disk image. A .dmg can only be *opened* — the user mounts it and
 * drags the app across, which is a manual install wearing the clothes of an automatic one. The zip
 * contains `Lyra.app` directly, so it can be unpacked and swapped in place. The dmg stays in the
 * release for people installing by hand the first time.
 *
 * Windows takes the setup executable, Linux the AppImage.
 *
 * **Architecture is checked on every platform, and a mismatch yields nothing rather than the wrong
 * file.** Only macOS used to look: Windows matched the first `.exe` in the list and Linux the first
 * `.AppImage`, and since GitHub returns assets alphabetically, `Lyra-0.6.1-arm64.exe` sorts before
 * `Lyra-0.6.1-x64.exe` — so every Intel Windows machine was being handed the ARM installer, and
 * every Intel Linux machine the ARM AppImage. It would download the whole thing and fail at the
 * end, which is the worst place to fail.
 *
 * A file with no architecture in its name is taken as universal, because it is: `Lyra-0.6.1.exe`
 * is the combined NSIS installer that carries both. That fallback is also what keeps older
 * releases installable, from before the artifact names carried an architecture at all.
