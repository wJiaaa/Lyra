/**
 * Every phase of an update, through every rule that draws it.
 *
 * The point of these is coverage of the *set*, not of any one case. A download has six phases and
 * two surfaces showing them, and the failures that actually happen are the combinations nobody
 * pictured: a percentage computed before the first response header arrives (45/0 → `Infinity%`),
 * a 继续 button greyed out in the one phase where continuing is the entire point, a 取消 offered
 * for a download that has not started. None of those is visible when reading one ternary; all of
 * them are visible when you walk the phases in a row.
 *
 * So `PHASES` is exported from the module under test rather than written out here — a phase added
 * later joins these tests automatically, instead of being the one nobody remembered to add.
