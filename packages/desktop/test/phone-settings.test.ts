/**
 * What a phone may change about the desktop's settings.
 *
 * `settings.save` used to write whatever it was handed, which was two problems wearing one coat.
 *
 * The reach: `hooks` and `scheduledTasks` are lists of shell commands the desktop runs by itself,
 * and `mcpServers` is a list of processes it launches. The allowlist next door is careful to omit
 * every method that touches a shell — and this one method handed the same reach back, to anyone
 * holding a pairing token, which is a secret that lives in a device people lose.
 *
 * The loss: a partial object replaced a complete one, so a field the phone did not send was gone
 * from disk. Found the shallow way round — a settings object carrying `{ appearance: { theme } }`
 * and nothing else reached the renderer and took the window down on `hex.trim`.
 *
 * As with the allowlist, most of this file is about what is *not* allowed.
