/**
 * The dock's five invariants, and the operations that have to keep them.
 *
 * These are worth stating as tests rather than as comments because every one of them is invisible
 * until it is violated, and then it is catastrophic in a way that looks like a rendering bug: a
 * split with one child draws a handle with nothing behind it, sizes that do not sum to 1 leave a
 * gap or an overlap at the far edge, and a duplicated kind mounts a terminal twice and kills one
 * of the shells.
 *
 * `invariants()` runs after every mutation in this file, so a rule broken anywhere is caught
 * everywhere rather than only by the test that happened to be looking.
