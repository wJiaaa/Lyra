/**
 * The renderer's half of the sub-agent link: events in, roster and transcripts out.
 *
 * This is the seam the core tests cannot reach and a screenshot cannot prove. Every failure here is
 * silent in the same way — the pane renders perfectly against state that never arrives, or arrives
 * and is dropped. Specifically:
 *
 *   - a roster event that is not applied leaves the bar hidden while work is being delegated;
 *   - a message applied to a transcript nobody opened would grow a list that is never read;
 *   - a message dropped *after* someone opened it leaves the pane frozen mid-run;
 *   - a roster left behind when the conversation changes attributes work to the wrong session.
