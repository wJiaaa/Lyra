/**
 * A list that refreshes itself, and the two things that has to be true of it.
 *
 * It must not redraw what did not change — a row keeping its identity is what stops a minute
 * timer from re-rendering the whole pane forever — and it must be able to say what did. Both are
 * rules over data, and both fail silently: a broken identity check looks like nothing at all, and
 * a broken unread rule looks like a list that is merely quiet.
