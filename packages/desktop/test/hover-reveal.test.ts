/**
 * Which hover-revealed controls the phone forces into view.
 *
 * Twenty-odd rows in the interface hide a control behind `group-hover`. A phone has no hover, so
 * those controls do not exist there — including copy, edit, rename, archive and delete, which is
 * most of what someone picks up a phone to do. One stylesheet rule reveals them, and the rule turns
 * on a distinction that is easy to get wrong and produces a mess when it is:
 *
 *     [class~="opacity-0"]   matches only a whole class name
 *     [class*="opacity-0"]   would also match `group-hover/project:opacity-0`
 *
 * The second kind is the *reverse* pattern — shown by default, hidden on hover — and it is used
 * for pairs of absolutely-positioned elements that swap places. Revealing both stacks them.
 *
 * Asserted against the class strings actually in the components: a test that invented its own would
 * pass while the rule missed everything it was written for.
