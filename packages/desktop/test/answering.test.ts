/**
 * When the running indicator stops being informative.
 *
 * It stays put for the whole of a turn on purpose: it used to appear only between tool calls, so
 * its 46px came and went and the transcript shifted up and down all through a turn. But once the
 * answer itself is streaming in above it, "Nearly there…" is describing something the reader can
 * already see, and sitting under a finished-looking answer saying almost-done reads as the app
 * having lost track of what it is doing.
 *
 * `proseLength` is imported rather than restated. The version of this file that restated it passed
 * every case below while the window was visibly broken, because the restatement modelled a reply
 * that talks and then calls a tool as *two messages* — and the real thing is one message holding
 * both. A rule copied into a test file cannot disagree with itself, which is the whole problem: it
 * can only agree with the copy.
