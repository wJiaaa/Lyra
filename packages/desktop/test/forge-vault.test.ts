/**
 * Forge tokens surviving an update, which is the whole point of moving them off the keychain.
 *
 * The failure being fixed: macOS builds are ad-hoc signed, so each release has a different code
 * identity, and a keychain entry is bound to the identity that wrote it. Signing in to GitHub was
 * therefore something you did after every update. See `config/vault.ts` in core.
 *
 * Three shapes can be on disk, and all three have to be handled without asking anyone to sign in
 * again to complete a migration whose purpose is to stop asking:
 *
 *   - sealed by the vault — the ordinary case now
 *   - plaintext — what a machine with no keyring got from the old code
 *   - sealed by the keychain — every macOS install written before this change
 *
 * The first two are covered here. The third needs Electron's `safeStorage`, which does not exist
 * in this process — `legacyKeychain()` returns null, and the token reads as needing a fresh
 * sign-in, which is exactly what it does on a machine whose keychain has stopped answering.
