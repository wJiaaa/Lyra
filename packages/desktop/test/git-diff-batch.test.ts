/**
 * The working-tree diff, after it stopped reading one file at a time.
 *
 * The claim being defended is that nothing about the *answer* changed when the reads were batched
 * — only how long they take. So this asserts on the things a reader of the panel would notice: a
 * modification is counted, an untracked file is entirely new, a deletion is entirely gone, an
 * image is listed as binary rather than diffed as text, and the totals add up to the files.
 *
 * The binary cases are the ones with history. Both sides of that used to be wrong in opposite
 * directions — a changed image vanished from the review, and a deleted one was diffed as five
 * lines of PNG header — so they are asserted rather than assumed.
