/**
 * Which shell a pane gets, and what it takes to end one.
 *
 * The whole point of this registry is that a shell outlives the pane showing it: panes are
 * unmounted constantly — closing one, switching to a conversation laid out differently, making
 * another pane full screen — and every one of those used to kill the shell underneath. So the
 * claims worth testing are all about identity and survival: connecting twice reaches the same
 * shell, a detach ends nothing, and what the shell said while nobody was watching comes back.
 *
 * Driven through `createTerminalRegistry` with a stand-in pty, so none of this needs Electron —
 * and so "did it spawn a second shell?" is a countable fact rather than something inferred from
 * output that looks familiar.
