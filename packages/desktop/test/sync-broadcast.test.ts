/**
 * Keeping a connected phone in step with the desktop.
 *
 * The phone reads the settings once when it boots and then subscribes. The subscription end was
 * there from the start; the sending end was not — so changing the theme, the model or the
 * permission mode on the desktop left the phone showing the old one until it was restarted. Found
 * by switching the desktop to a light theme with a phone in hand and watching it stay dark.
 *
 * Run over a real socket, because "did the client actually receive it" is the entire question and a
 * fake one answers it by construction.
