/**
 * Which of this machine's addresses to put in front of someone pairing a phone.

 * A development machine holds several and they are indistinguishable by shape: Docker's bridge,
 * a VPN's tun, VirtualBox's host-only adapter and the actual Wi-Fi address are all private IPv4.
 * The first one in the list is what the QR code carries, so picking wrong does not produce an
 * error — it produces a scan that succeeds and a connection that times out, which is the hardest
 * kind of failure to attribute.
