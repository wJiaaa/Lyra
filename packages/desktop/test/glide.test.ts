/**
 * Which run's summary line glides, and — the part that keeps breaking — when React is told.
 *
 * This bug has now survived three fixes, and the tests are the reason. They used to check a *copy*
 * of the rule, rewritten into this file as `glides(index, total, running)`, and a copy cannot
 * disagree with the thing it was copied from. The copy said "the last run, while the turn runs",
 * which is exactly what the app said, and both were wrong in the same way: the last run in the
 * transcript stays the last run after you ask something else, so a finished stretch of work went
 * on gliding through the whole of the next reply. Every test here passed while it did.
 *
 * So nothing below reimplements anything. `runs` marks the live run and `sameRun` is the memo
 * comparison, both imported from the code that runs. What the tests supply is transcripts.
