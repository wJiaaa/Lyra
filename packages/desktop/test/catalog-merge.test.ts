/**
 * Merging three sources into one list, and getting each entry's kind right.
 *
 * The rule under test is the one the catalogue was rebuilt around: a bundle on disk is whatever
 * its contents make it, and a registry index cannot overrule that. It matters because the index
 * this was built against is wrong about seven of its nine entries — every MCP server in it is
 * listed as a plugin — so "trust the index" and "read the disk" produce different pages, and only
 * one of them matches what installing actually did.
 *
 * The last test is the grey screen: the main process does not hot-reload, so a renderer can be
 * talking to a build that has never heard of `mcpBundles`. That used to throw before anything
 * rendered, which took the whole window with it.
