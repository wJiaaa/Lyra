/**
 * Downloading an update, paused and resumed against a real server.
 *
 * A real one, because every interesting thing here is a conversation with an HTTP server and none
 * of it can be reasoned about from a stub: whether the range came back as 206 or was ignored with a
 * 200, whether the bytes that arrive continue the bytes on disk or repeat them, what a socket cut
 * halfway leaves behind. `node:http` on a loopback port is a few lines and answers all of it.
 *
 * The failure this is really guarding against is the quiet one. Appending a 200 to a partial file
 * produces a file of plausible length made of the wrong bytes — the first half twice — which
 * unpacks into something that is not an app, and reports itself as a bad release rather than as a
 * bad resume. Nothing about that is visible without checking the actual contents, so these tests
 * check the actual contents.
