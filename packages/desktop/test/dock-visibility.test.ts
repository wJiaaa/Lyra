/**
 * Which panes are actually on screen, across every arrangement the dock can be in.
 *
 * This is the question the open file's header asks before offering the project tree under its
 * name: with the tree pane visible the dropdown is a second copy of a list already on screen, and
 * with it hidden the dropdown is the only way to reach another file. So every combination below is
 * one of those two answers being wrong in a way somebody would notice.
 *
 * The case that matters is the one where "open" and "visible" come apart — a window narrow enough
 * that the dock shows one pane at a time — because that is exactly what a check for "is it open"
 * gets wrong.
