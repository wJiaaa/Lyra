/**
 * Dealing syntax colours back out to diff rows.
 *
 * A hunk is parsed as two passages — the file before the change and the file after — because a
 * block comment or a template literal has to keep its colour across the lines it spans, and only
 * whole-passage parsing can see that. Which leaves one thing to get right: putting the coloured
 * lines back against the rows they came from.
 *
 * That is worth testing precisely because getting it wrong is invisible. A row still renders,
 * still has colours, and they are simply the colours of a different line. Nothing throws and
 * nothing looks broken — it just quietly stops meaning anything.
 *
 * The tokenizer is stubbed here: what is under test is the alignment, not the grammar.
