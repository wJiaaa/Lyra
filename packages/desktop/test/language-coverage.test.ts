/**

 * The failure this guards against is silent by construction: a grammar that does not load, or one

 * one colour — which looks like a theme choice rather than a bug, and is exactly how `nginx`,
 * `yaml` and every other stream-mode grammar went unnoticed for months.
 *
 * So the measurement is per language and it is about *distinctions*: how many kinds of token the
 * sample resolves to, and how much of it nothing claimed at all.
