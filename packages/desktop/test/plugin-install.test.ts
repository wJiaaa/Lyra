/**
 * Installing and uninstalling, all the way through: files on disk *and* rows in settings.
 *
 * The two halves are separately correct and jointly wrong more often than either alone. An MCP
 * bundle is a directory and a set of settings rows, and the only thing tying them together is
 * `origin.bundle` — stamped on the rows at install, matched against at uninstall. Every failure
 * mode here is quiet: a server still in the list after its directory is gone, two copies of a
 * server after installing twice, or a server switched on by an install rather than by a person.
 *
 * Nothing is mocked. `installEntry` really clones — `git` treats a local path as a remote, so these
 * build real repositories in a temporary directory — and the settings really go through the same
 * functions the IPC handlers call. What is not covered here is the wiring itself: `plugins.ts`
 * imports `electron`, which a test runner cannot load, so it is kept to ordering and handler
 * registration with the decisions in `plugin-actions.ts` where they can be reached.
