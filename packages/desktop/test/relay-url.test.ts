/**
 * Reading whatever someone typed into the relay field.

 * There is no picker for this — it is a text box on a settings page, filled in by hand from a
 * README, a chat message or memory. The same relay gets typed as a bare host, with a scheme, with a
 * port, with a trailing slash, and all of them mean the same thing. Getting any of them wrong is a
 * connection that silently never forms, on the one code path that exists for people who have no
