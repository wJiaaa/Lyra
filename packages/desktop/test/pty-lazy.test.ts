/**
 * node-pty is loaded when a terminal is opened, and failing to load it costs the terminal only.
 *
 * It was a static import at the top of `main.ts`. The Linux packages compile it on Ubuntu 24.04,
 * so `pty.node` needs glibc 2.34 — and on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11 or RHEL 8 the dynamic loader
 * refused it before a single line of the app ran. No window, no error, nothing: one native module
 * for one panel took the whole main process down.
