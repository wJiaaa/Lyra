/**
 * The built-in terminal takes a new theme in the same moment as everything around it.
 *
 * xterm paints to its own surface, so its colours are pushed in by hand rather than picked up from
 * CSS. They used to be pushed from the terminal's own effect, which React runs before the effect in
 * `App` that writes the theme onto the document — so the terminal read the `dark` class and the code
 * background of the theme being left, and showed them until something re-ran it. Measured in a real
 * window: one to two painted frames late after a switch in settings, and never at all when the system
 * appearance changed under 「跟随系统」, since nothing in React changes then.
