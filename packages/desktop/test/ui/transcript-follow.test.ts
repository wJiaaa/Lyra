/**
 * `useFollowBottom` against a DOM, which is where the rule in `follow.ts` meets the events that
 * actually arrive.
 *
 * The state machine is covered exhaustively in `test/scroll-follow.test.ts` and needs no browser.
 * What needs one is the wiring: which listener hears which gesture, what is treated as the reader
 * and what is treated as the program, and whether a transcript that should be riding its own bottom
 * is in fact put back against it.
 *
 * That last question is the reason half of this file exists. Every test written when this code was
 * rewritten asked the *opposite* one — that a transcript scrolled up in is not dragged back down —
 * because the four bugs being fixed were all of that kind. Nothing asserted that following works,
 * so when it stopped working during tool runs, the entire suite stayed green.
 *
 * Geometry is supplied by the harness because happy-dom performs no layout: `scrollHeight` and
 * `clientHeight` are whatever the test says they are, and `scrollTop` clamps against them the way a
 * browser's would.
