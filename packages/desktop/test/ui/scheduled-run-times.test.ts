/**
 * The "last run" and "next run" lines on a scheduled task's card.
 *
 * The label and the time used to be two strings laid side by side, with the colon at the end of the
 * label. That only reads right in Chinese, whose full-width colon carries its own spacing: the
 * English page said "Last run:9/26/2026", and French, Russian, Korean and Japanese were glued the
 * same way. Where the space goes is part of the sentence, so each catalogue now holds the whole line
 * with the time as a variable, and this looks at what the card actually prints.
