/**
 * The project row above each screen's composer names that screen's project.
 *
 * It read `workspace`, which belongs to the live slot — the focused conversation. With two projects
 * side by side, the screen without focus wore the other one's project and branch, and swapped them
 * every time focus moved (measured in a real window: `e2e/split-scope-probe.ts project`). The website
 * script kept its split screenshot to one project to hide it. The blank screen was the same: opened
 * in alpha, it asked 「要在 beta-lib 内开发什么？」 as soon as beta took focus beside it.
