/**
 * An undo made on one surface of a turn reaches every other surface showing that turn.
 *
 * Undo writes the file back and leaves the turn's record alone, so the rows and their +N −M stay as
 * they were; what changes is whether each file can still be undone. The card read that once, on
 * mount: an undo made in the review beside it left the card offering 「撤销」 for the whole turn, and
 * the main process refused it. A popped-out pane is another renderer and heard nothing of an undo
 * made on the card. These mount the card and the pane the way a screen and a panel window do, and
 * stand in for another window with the `storage` event its undo raises here.
