/**
 * A split's blank screen speaks for itself.
 *
 * The website's screenshot script found it: open a new conversation, drag a finished one in beside
 * it, type into the fresh screen — and the message went to the conversation beside it, the one with
 * focus. Reproduced in a real window by mouse and by keyboard alike (`e2e/split-scope-probe.ts`).
 *
 * The blank screen had no way to be the live conversation. Focusing it moved the split's focus and
 * nothing else; its composer had no id to name, and leaving the id out of `send` meant "the live
 * one"; and every scoped read on it answered with the live slot — the other conversation's running
 * turn, its stop button, its model. These are the three halves, each pinned here.
