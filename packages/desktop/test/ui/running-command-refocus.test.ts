/**
 * A command still running in a conversation that leaves the live slot and comes back.
 *
 * Split view makes this ordinary: focus moves to the screen beside it, the command keeps printing
 * into the parked copy, and focusing its screen again re-reads the conversation from the main
 * process. That read rebuilt tool state from the log alone — where the reply asking for the command
 * is already final (`toolUse`) and the result is not written until the command ends — so the
 * running command came back drawn as failed, and stayed a red cross until it finished. A screen
 * warmed while its command runs read it the same way.
