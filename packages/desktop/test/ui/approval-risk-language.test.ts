/**
 * Why the approval card is asking, in the window's language.
 *
 * The gate used to write the risk rule's sentence into the top of the card's text, and the rules
 * only had Chinese: an English window asked about `git push --force` under 「强制推送会覆盖远程
 * 历史」. The finding now arrives beside the text as a rule code, and the card words it from the
 * catalogues — the same line in the same place, in whichever language the window is set to.
