/**
 * 「继续」 under a failed turn speaks to the conversation of the screen it is drawn in.
 *
 * The send named no conversation, which means the live one — in a split, whichever screen has focus.
 * A press focuses its screen first, so the mouse picked the right one; from the keyboard the carry-on
 * went into the conversation beside it (measured in a real window: `e2e/split-scope-rest-probe.ts
 * hiccup`, where the fake model was asked to carry on in the other project). `ResumeRow`, the same
 * entry point wearing another row, already names its screen — see `resume-row-scope.test.ts`.
