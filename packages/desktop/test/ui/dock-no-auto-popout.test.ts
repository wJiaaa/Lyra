/**
 * Nothing opens a native window unless a person asked for one.
 *
 * The dock used to hand a panel to a real window whenever the layout could not hold its floors —
 * on a window resize, on a second split screen, on a cold start with a narrow window. It was
 * removed in `docs/architecture/split-window-conflicts.md` §6,
 * and these are the guards that keep it removed: the three entry points that used to reach for
 * `windows.openPanel` on their own, plus the panel that must never be handed over at all.
