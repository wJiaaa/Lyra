/**
 * The offer to keep a correction as a rule belongs to the conversation that made it.
 *
 * It was one slot for the live conversation, drawn at the end of every transcript on screen. Measured
 * in a real window (`e2e/split-scope-rest-probe.ts rule`): the card stood under both screens of a
 * split, and when focus moved to the other screen the offer was dropped unanswered. An offer from
 * the conversation beside the focused one never showed at all.
