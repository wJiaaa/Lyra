/**
 * Toasts centre on what is beside the sidebar — in a window that has a sidebar.

 * A popped-out panel and a conversation in its own window draw none, but the layout still carried the
 * main window's open flag and remembered width, so the stack started a sidebar's width in and every
 * toast sat half a sidebar right of the window's middle.
