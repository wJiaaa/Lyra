/**
 * Text left for the composer lands in the composer of the screen it was left for, and in no other.
 *
 * `composerDraft` is one slot for the whole window, and every mounted composer took whatever was in
 * it, in the same commit. A split mounts a composer per screen, so a suggestion card pressed on the
 * blank screen typed itself into the conversation beside it as well — and the caret followed it
 * there. Reproduced in a real window by mouse and by keyboard (`e2e/split-draft-probe.ts`).
 *
 * A draft now names its screen the way `send` does: a conversation's id, or null for the blank one.
 * The screen that takes it takes the live slot too, since a card reached by keyboard had no press on
 * the screen to do that first.
