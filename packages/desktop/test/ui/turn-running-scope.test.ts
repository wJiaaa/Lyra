/**
 * What a screen shows about "is a turn running" follows that screen's conversation.
 *
 * Two readers still asked the live slot's `running`, which is the focused screen's turn:
 *
 *   The context reading under a composer re-reads its breakdown when its conversation finishes a
 *   turn and holds still while one runs. With the focused conversation running, the reading under
 *   the screen beside it froze across that screen's own finished turns; with the focused one idle, a
 *   running screen beside it re-read on every message. A summary in the focused conversation re-read
 *   every screen's.
 *
 *   The newest reasoning in a transcript types itself out while its turn runs. Under a screen whose
 *   turn had stopped, reasoning cut short by that stop started typing again whenever the focused
 *   conversation was running.
 *
 * Both measured in a real window (`e2e/split-scope-more-probe.ts meter` and `thinking`).
