/**
 * The three ways a call to a remote can end, and why they must not look alike.
 *
 * The panel disables its other sync buttons while one of these is in flight, so an operation with
 * no bound is a panel someone is stuck inside. Bounding it is only half of it: a timeout has to be
 * *recognisable* afterwards, because `execFile` kills the process and git therefore leaves nothing
 * on stderr — the generic path would put `Command failed: git fetch --prune` in the red bar, which
 * names the command and not the problem.
 *
 * The hang is produced by a server that accepts the connection and then says nothing, which is what
 * a host behind a dead proxy does. A refused connection fails in milliseconds and would prove
 * nothing about the timeout.
