/**
 * Which conversations go with a project when it is removed.
 *
 * The report was that a project deleted from disk could not be removed from Plume. Archiving only
 * the chats whose `cwd` matched exactly was half of why: the sidebar builds a group per distinct
 * `cwd`, so anything started one directory down came back as its own group the moment the entry
 * was dropped.
