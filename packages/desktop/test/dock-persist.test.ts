/**
 * What comes back out of storage, and what is done to it before it is believed.
 *
 * A stored layout is the one piece of the dock written by a version of this app that no longer
 * exists. It can name a panel a plugin used to provide, it can have been hand-edited, and it can
 * be a string where a tree should be. None of that should reach the renderer: a tree that fails
 * to load costs the user their arrangement, and a tree that loads *badly* paints an empty window
 * — which from the outside is indistinguishable from a crash.
 *
 * So `sanitize` never throws and never returns null. Every test here hands it something wrong and
 * checks that what comes back is a layout the dock can render.
