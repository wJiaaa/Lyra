/**
 * Switching a plugin on and off, which is not the set operation it looks like.
 *
 * Two things make it awkward, and both produce the same symptom when got wrong: a switch that
 * reports a change and produces none, with the plugin still off after a reload.
 *
 * The wildcard is the first. `disabledPlugins: ["*"]` means "none of them", and turning one back on
 * has to name what the wildcard stood for rather than just deleting an id that was never in the
 * list. The second is the old name: entries written by earlier versions hold the manifest's name
 * where they now hold the directory, and the loader reads both when deciding `enabled`.
