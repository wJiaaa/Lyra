 * Which end of the window row the system took, and how much of it.

 * The window's own controls are drawn over the page rather than in it, so nothing in the document
 * can measure them and every one of these numbers has to be decided rather than observed. Getting
 * it wrong is not subtle: on Windows the panel buttons ended up underneath the close button, drawn
 * and unpressable, and the sidebar toggle sat 78px in — clear of traffic lights that only macOS
 * has, and out of line with every mark below it.
