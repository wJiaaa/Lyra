/**
 * Which settings pages a phone gets, and which page it lands on.
 *
 * Two failures worth a test rather than a bug report. One: a group whose every item was hidden
 * renders as a heading with nothing under it, which reads as a section that failed to load. Two:
 * the desktop remembers which settings page it was last on and the phone shares that memory — so
 * arriving directly at a hidden page is not a hypothetical, and the result would be a blank pane
 * with no row selected and nothing saying why.
