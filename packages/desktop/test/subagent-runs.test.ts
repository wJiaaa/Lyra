/**
 * The records a sub-agent panel draws its tool cards from.
 *
 * These exist because of a regression worth naming. The panel was changed to reuse the main
 * conversation's `ToolRun`, whose cards look their record up in the app store — and a sub-agent's
 * tool events never reach that store, because `runSubAgent` emits only the messages it produced.
 * Every card therefore found nothing, and a card that finds nothing after its turn has ended calls
 * itself an error: a panel full of successful work, drawn entirely in red crosses, with the raw
 * tool name where the summary should be.
 *
 * Nothing about that is visible to a typecheck — the props all match — so it is pinned here.
