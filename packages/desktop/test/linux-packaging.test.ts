/**
 * What the Linux (and Windows) packages need from `package.json` and `electron-builder.yml`.
 *
 * None of these can be seen from a macOS build, and each of them was wrong:
 *
 *   - No `desktopName`, so Electron derived one from the package name — `@plume/desktop.desktop` —
 *     and the Wayland app_id matched no installed `.desktop` file: a generic icon in the dock,
 *     windows not grouped under their launcher, and the GlobalShortcuts portal refusing every
 *     binding without a word.
 *   - The legacy FUSE2 AppImage runtime, which Ubuntu 22.04 and later do not ship: double-clicking
 *     the AppImage did nothing.
 *   - `build/icon.png` was never packaged, so `appIconPath()` was undefined in every release and
 *     Linux windows and notifications had no icon.
