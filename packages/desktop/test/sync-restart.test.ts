/**
 * Turning the sync service on, twice, which is what turning it on once actually does.
 *
 * The IPC handler writes `sync.enabled: true` and returns `startSync()`. Writing that setting is
 * itself what starts the server — the settings hook in `main.ts` watches for it — so by the time
 * the handler starts it, it is running. The second call used to tear the listener down and rebind,
 * racing its own close, and the toggle reported `EADDRINUSE` about the service it had just
 * successfully started.
 *
 * Started on a real port because that is the whole failure: it is about binding, and a fake socket
 * binds nothing.
