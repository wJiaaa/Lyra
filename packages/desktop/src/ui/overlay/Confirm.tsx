/**
 * Asking before something cannot be taken back.
 *
 * The app deletes plenty of things on a single click — a plugin's directory, a model, an MCP
 * server, a file, a whole session — and every one of them is a click's distance from a control you
 * were aiming at anyway.
 *
 * One shape for all of them, centred over the window on a scrim. It used to be anchored to the
 * control that raised it, on the theory that the connection between the button and the question is
 * worth keeping. In practice that produced a different answer in every corner of the app: a card
 * hanging off a menu here, a card at the pointer there, and in a panel opened to full screen a
 * question that appeared wherever the row happened to be rather than where you were looking. A
 * question that stops everything should look like one, and there is exactly one place a modal
 * belongs.
 *
 * Two ways in, one look and one place:
 *
 *   - `useConfirmer()` for a page full of delete buttons — wrap the handler, render `element` once;
 *   - `useConfirmGate()` when the answer has to be awaited inside a loop.
 *
 * Only for what cannot be undone. Archiving, disabling and unpinning all put themselves back, and
 * a confirmation on those teaches people to click through the ones that matter.
