/**
 * A button whose label is an icon.
 *
 * Every toolbar in the app had grown its own: five heights, three corner radii, and press
 * feedback that ranged from nothing to a 10% shrink. The shrink is gone on purpose — a control
 * that jumps away from the pointer at the moment of contact reads as unstable, and at these
 * sizes it is a wobble rather than a press. Pressing is shown by the fill going one step
 * darker, which is what a real button does: it stays exactly where it is and changes state.
 *
 * The label is both the tooltip and the accessible name, so a caller cannot ship one without
 * the other — which is how icon-only toolbars end up unreadable to screen readers.
