/**
 * The button, in the four shapes this application actually uses.
 *
 * There were 276 hand-written `<button>` in the renderer and at least eight heights among them —
 * 26, 28, 30, 32, 44 — none of them different on purpose. A row of controls that do not share a
 * baseline reads as two toolbars pushed together, and that is what several of them looked like.
 *
 * `GhostButton` and `PrimaryButton` were already here, in `settings/controls.tsx`, and were already
 * imported from outside settings. This is those two plus the states they kept growing by hand:
 * a size for dense rows, and a loading state that every async action was reimplementing with a
 * disabled flag and a spinner beside it.
 *
 * Not a general-purpose button library. Four variants, two sizes, and no `style` prop — the point
 * is that a caller cannot invent a ninth height.
