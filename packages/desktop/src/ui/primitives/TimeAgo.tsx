/**
 * A span of time that keeps up with itself.
 *
 * "刚刚" written into the DOM at 14:02 still says 刚刚 at 14:40 — which used to be a fair trade,
 * because nothing stayed on screen that long. A list that refreshes itself changes that: the rows
 * update underneath you and the ages beside them do not, so the one part of the row that is purely
 * a function of the clock became the one part that was wrong.
 *
 * One timer for every instance, held in module scope and running only while something is mounted.
 * A tick re-renders the labels and nothing else — the rows themselves are memoised on their data,
 * which has not changed — so keeping sixty ages honest costs sixty text nodes a minute.
