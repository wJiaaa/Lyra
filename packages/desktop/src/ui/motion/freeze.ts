/**
 * Holding still for the length of a drag.
 *
 * A few elements ease towards their new geometry, which is right when a layout changes on its own
 * and wrong while a pointer is moving the boundary: each frame starts a transition the next frame
 * overrides, so the pane trails the pointer instead of tracking it and never quite settles.
 *
 * The freeze used to be a flag on `<html>` and rules keyed on it — `:root[data-resizing] *`. That
 * reads well and is the single most expensive thing this app did while dragging. Measured against
 * a real session of 8,948 messages, 8,585 elements on screen:
 *
 *   set data-dock-dragging   94ms      (universal selector)
 *   set data-dock-dragging   44ms      (after narrowing it to `:root[data-…] .ly-dock-pane`)
 *   set an unrelated attr     0ms      (the control)
 *
 * Narrowing the selector is not enough, and the middle line is why. An attribute on an ancestor
 * still has to be resolved against the subtree beneath it, so a flag on the root is a question
 * asked about the whole document however specific the answer turns out to be — and a drag flips
 * two or three of these on the way in and again on the way out. That was the stall at the moment
 * you grabbed something: not the layout, not React, one attribute.
 *
 * So the elements are named instead. `.ly-freeze` marks the ones whose geometry a drag actually
 * changes — the panes, the frame the sidebar sits in, the collapsible groups whose height follows
 * what fits — and this adds a class to exactly those, which the style engine resolves through its
 * class index without walking anything.

 * An attribute, not a class, and this is not a stylistic choice.
 *
 * React owns `className` on these elements and writes the whole attribute whenever the string it
 * renders changes. A class added here by hand is silently wiped by that write, and the pane it was
 * holding still is released in the middle of the gesture — it then eases into a layout it should
 * have jumped to, a second, wrong drift.
 *
 * React does not touch attributes it was not given, so this survives the render.

/**
 * Hold the moving parts still, and hand back the release.
 *
 * The elements are collected once, at the start. A drag lasts a few hundred milliseconds and the
 * set does not change within one: the dock rearranges by moving panes that already exist, which is
 * the whole reason a pane keeps its terminal across a drop.
 *
 * A pane that does not exist yet is therefore out of scope here, and deliberately so — see
 * `data-dock-settling` in `styles.css` for the one case that needs it and why it is worth what it
 * costs there.
 *
 * Reference-counted, because two of these overlap in ordinary use: dragging the sidebar's edge
 * far enough resizes the window's content area, and a window resize freezes as well. Without the
 * count the first release would unfreeze under the second drag, which is the judder this prevents.

/**
 * Stop the panes taking the pointer, for the length of a pane being carried.

 * A pane may hold a <webview>, which is a separate process: it swallows the pointer the moment the
 * drag crosses it, and pointer capture — which handles same-document iframes — cannot reach it.
 * Declining hit tests on the panes is what covers that case; the drag listens on the window, so it
 * is unaffected.
 *
 * Applied the same way and for the same reasons as the freeze above: this used to be
 * `:root[data-dock-dragging] .ly-dock-pane`, and the flag is on the root of a document holding a
 * transcript — and it is an attribute rather than a class because React rewrites `className` on
 * these elements the moment a pane is picked up.
