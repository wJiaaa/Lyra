/**
 * The last thing between a thrown error and a grey window.
 *
 * React unmounts the entire tree when an error reaches the root uncaught, so one component
 * throwing took the whole app with it — and what was left was the window's background colour and
 * three traffic lights. No message, no stack, nothing to act on; from the outside it is
 * indistinguishable from a hang, a failed build, or a crash of the main process.
 *
 * This does not make anything work that did not. It makes the failure legible: what threw, where,
 * and the one action worth offering, which is reloading the renderer. In a desktop app that is a
 * real recovery — the main process, the sessions and the settings are all still alive on the other
 * side of the IPC boundary, and only this window has to be rebuilt.
 *
 * A class, because `getDerivedStateFromError` has no hook equivalent. It is the only one in the
 * codebase and this is the reason.
