/**
 * Translating outside a component, for the code that has no hook to reach for.
 *
 * `useI18n` covers everything that renders. It does not cover the rest of what a person reads: the
 * notices the store raises when a send fails, the sentence `hiccup.ts` builds for a dropped
 * connection, the labels a plain function returns for a menu it does not own. Those had the language
 * written into them, so switching the interface to English left them in Chinese — which is most of
 * what "the settings are translated but the app is not" turned out to mean.
 *
 * Threading a `t` through every one of those call sites was the alternative, and it is worse than it
 * sounds: `describeHiccup` would take a translator to return a string, and so would everything that
 * calls it, all the way up to a component — for a value that depends on one global thing, the
 * language the window is set to. So the language lives here instead, and `I18nProvider` keeps it in
 * step; see `setActiveLocale`.
 *
 * The catalogue is the same one the hook reads, and both come down to `translateIn`, so a key cannot
 * mean two different things depending on which of the two found it, and `MessageKey` still makes a
 * missing translation a type error.
 *
 * **Import this file directly from a `.ts` module — not `i18n/index.ts`.** The barrel re-exports
 * `context.tsx`, and a plain-TypeScript module that pulls it in stops being loadable by
 * `node --test --experimental-strip-types`, which does not know what to do with a `.tsx`. It shows
 * up as `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` in a test that has nothing to do with i18n — `syncPlan.ts`'s
 * suite went red that way. Type-only imports from the barrel are fine: they leave no runtime trace.
