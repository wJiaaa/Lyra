/**
 * A list of things, punctuated the way the interface language punctuates one.
 *
 * Lists used to be joined with a hardcoded 「、」, so the English interface summed up a run of tool
 * calls as "Read files merge.ts、Created files merge.test.ts". The separator belongs to the language,
 * not to the sentence it sits in, which is why it is looked up here instead of written at each call.
 *
 * It comes from `Intl.ListFormat`, but not from `format()`: a conjunction style closes a list with
 * "and" — "and" in English at `long` — and a summary line is a tally, not a sentence. `type: "unit"`
 * has no conjunction, but CLDR joins Chinese units with nothing at all (the pattern behind
 * 「3小时20分钟」), which would run the parts together. What is left is the literal between two middle
 * items: the language's own list comma, which never carries a conjunction — 「、」 in Chinese,
 * ", " in English.
 *
 * For items of one kind. Fields or clauses — a name and its description — take `common.comma`
 * instead, because Chinese separates those with 「，」 rather than 「、」.
