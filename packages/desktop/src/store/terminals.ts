/**
 * Which terminals are open, and which one each terminal pane is looking at.
 *
 * The shells themselves live in the main process and outlive everything here — this is only the
 * panes' view of them. Each terminal is a tab of the dock, keyed by `terminalSlot`.
 *
 * One list, not one per project. It used to be keyed by project directory, which tied the strip to
 * whatever the rest of the window happened to be showing: changing projects swapped the terminals
 * for a different set, and moving to no project at all emptied it — while every one of those shells
 * carried on running, unreachable. A terminal is not a view of the project, it is a thing you
 * started and are using; closing a folder in an editor does not close the build you are watching.
 *
 * The project still decides where a *new* shell starts — the current one, or home when there is
 * none — and that is the whole of the relationship between them.
 *
 * Outside React because several things need it — the pane itself, its tab's title, and closing the
 * tab — and they are not in a position to pass it between them.
