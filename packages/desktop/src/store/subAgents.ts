/**
 * What the window knows about the work this session has delegated.
 *
 * Two halves, kept apart on purpose. The roster — who is running, how long, how many tool calls —
 * arrives as an event on every change, because it is a dozen small rows and the whole point is
 * that it is live. The transcripts are pulled per sub-agent and then kept up to date by the
 * messages that stream in, because a delegated run can read forty files and broadcasting all of
 * that on every change would put the run on the wire dozens of times over.
 *
 * The live fields are keyed by nothing: they belong to the session in the live slot, and when that
 * changes they are emptied — a sub-agent belongs to the conversation that dispatched it, and
 * showing one under another conversation would be a lie about where the work came from. With two
 * screens the other conversation is on display too, so every roster is also kept by session id in
 * `rosters`, and a screen reads its own through `useScopedSubAgents`.
