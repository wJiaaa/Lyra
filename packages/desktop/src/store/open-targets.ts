/**
 * 「用什么打开」, as the window sees it.
 *
 * The list itself is the main process's answer — which applications are installed, what this
 * platform calls its file manager, what each one's icon looks like — because none of that is
 * knowable from a page. See `electron/open-targets.ts`.
 *
 * Fetched once for the whole window rather than per component. Several different places offer to
 * open a file (the editor's toolbar, the file tree's menu, the tree's own action, the setting
 * itself, the attachment strip) and asking each time would shell out to `mdfind` on each of them.
 *
 * 住在 `store/` 而不是 `features/files/`，尽管文件树是它最早的用户。「这台机器能用什么打开文件」
 * 是全窗口共用的一份事实，不是文件树的私产——而把它留在那个域里意味着别人只能走 `files/index.ts`
 * 那扇门进来，那扇门后面挂着查看器、转录、浏览器面板。附件条要用它时，这条路绕成了一个环
 * （`pnpm arch` 拦下的就是它）。往下搬一层，谁都够得着，且谁也不会因此多拖进一棵组件树。
