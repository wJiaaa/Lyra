 * which are further checkouts of the same history on other branches. All of it was being found
 * and none of it was reachable: the panel picked whichever repository sorted first and gave no
 * way to say otherwise.
 *
 * Worktrees are nested under the repository they belong to rather than listed as peers, because
 * that is what they are. Sharing one history is the whole point of a worktree, and a flat list
 * would put two checkouts of the same project side by side as though they were separate work.
