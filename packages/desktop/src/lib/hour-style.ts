/**
 * Whether the hour gets a leading zero, which depends on the clock the language tells time by.
 *
 * On a 24-hour clock "09:05" is the ordinary way to write it, and the Chinese interface has always
 * shown it that way. On a 12-hour clock the zero reads as a typo — "02:28 PM" — so English goes
 * without.
 *
 * This replaces `hour: "2-digit"` in a format written back when it only ever spoke Chinese. A format
 * that asked for `"numeric"` already leaves the hour alone in every language, and switching it over
 * would pad a Chinese 9:05 that was never padded.
 *
 * Kept per language: every message row asks, and the answer only changes with the language.
