/**
 * Which house made this model.
 *
 * Plume points at whatever endpoint you give it, so there is no vendor field to read — the only
 * things known about a model are the id you typed and the name you gave it. Both are matched,
 * because neither is reliable alone: a relay exposes `deepseek-v4-flash` with the display name
 * 「DeepSeek V4 Flash」, a gateway prefixes ids with `anthropic/`, and somebody's private proxy
 * calls the same model `fast`. Two chances to recognise it is better than one, and a wrong match
 * only ever costs a wrong logo, never a wrong request.
 *
 * Word boundaries matter more than they look. `o3` as a substring appears inside `qwen-o3`-style
 * ids that have nothing to do with OpenAI, and worse, inside version strings — so the short
 * OpenAI aliases are matched as whole words while the long unambiguous names are matched
 * anywhere. Chinese names are matched without boundaries: `\b` is defined on ASCII word
 * characters and never fires between two Han characters.
 *
 * Order is priority. `deepseek-v3` must not become OpenAI on the strength of a `v3`, so the
 * unambiguous vendors are asked first.
