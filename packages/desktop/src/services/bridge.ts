 * The one place `window.lyra` is named.
 *
 * Everything the renderer asks of the main process goes through this object, and it is reached
 * through `services/` rather than directly — 87 files used to name it, which made two questions
 * unanswerable without searching all of them: what does this window actually call, and what would
 * have to change to test any of it.
 *
 * `oxlint` enforces the rule (`no-restricted-properties` on `window.lyra`), with this file,
 * `host.ts` and `web-bridge.ts` exempted. A lint rule rather than a convention because the convention held for exactly
 * as long as somebody was watching.
 *
 * In an Electron window the object is built by the preload out of IPC channels. In a browser that
 * opened this interface through Web access there is no preload, and `web-bridge.ts` builds it out
 * of one WebSocket instead — the renderer cannot tell the difference, and that is the design. What
 * *does* differ is which methods answer: see `host.ts`.
