 * The one place `window.plume` is named.
 *
 * Everything the renderer asks of the main process goes through this object, and it is reached
 * through `services/` rather than directly — 87 files used to name it, which made three questions
 * unanswerable without searching all of them: what does this window actually call, which of those
 * calls work on a phone, and what would have to change to test any of it.
 *
 * `oxlint` enforces the rule (`no-restricted-properties` on `window.plume`), with this file and
 * `host.ts` exempted. A lint rule rather than a convention because the convention held for exactly
 * as long as somebody was watching.
 *
 * ## Two hosts
 *
 * On the desktop this is built by the preload out of IPC channels. On a phone it is built by
 * `mobile/src/bridge.ts` out of HTTP and one WebSocket, and the renderer cannot tell the
 * difference — that is the whole design. What *does* differ is which methods answer: see `host.ts`.
