 * The overlay, fetched only when this window is one.

 * A screenshot overlay window and the main window are mutually exclusive — the hash decides, at
 * load, and neither ever becomes the other. Importing the overlay statically meant every
 * application window carried the annotator it will never open.
 *
 * `App` is *not* lazy, and that is deliberate. It is what this window is unless the hash says
 * otherwise, so deferring it buys nothing — the bytes move to another chunk and arrive a moment
 * later. What it cost was real: the dock mounts after Suspense resolves rather than in the first
 * commit, and `dock-settle.test.ts` caught a pane replaying its entrance animation because of it.
 * A pane already on screen is not supposed to fade in again.
