/**
 * The tool records for a delegated run, rebuilt from its own transcript.
 *
 * The main conversation's cards look themselves up in the app store, which is filled by
 * `tool_start` / `tool_end` as they arrive. A sub-agent's never get there: `runSubAgent` emits the
 * messages it produced and nothing else, deliberately — a delegated run that read forty files
 * would otherwise put forty tool events on the parent's wire for work the parent did not do.
 *
 * So the records are derived instead, from what the transcript already says: a call is running
 * from the reply that made it until its result arrives, and the result says how it ended. Without
 * this the cards find no record, fall back to "the turn is over, so the call must have failed",
 * and a panel full of successful work is drawn entirely in red.
