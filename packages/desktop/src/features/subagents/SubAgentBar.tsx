/**
 * That work has been delegated, said above the composer.
 *
 * Delegation was invisible: the parent dispatched a sub-agent, the transcript said 「派发子任务 2 个」
 * in the same grey as everything else, and for the next two minutes nothing on screen distinguished
 * "reading forty files on your behalf" from "stuck". The point of a sub-agent is that its context
 * stays out of the parent's — which is also what makes it opaque, so it needs somewhere of its own
 * to be seen.
 *
 * Above the composer because that is where the answer to "what is happening right now" belongs, and
 * because it is the one place in the window that is on screen in every layout. It appears only when
 * there is something to say and takes a single line when it does.
