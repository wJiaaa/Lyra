/**
 * The way back down, offered only while there is a way back down.
 *
 * A transcript you have scrolled up in has no other route to the newest message than dragging all
 * the way — and while a turn is streaming, "all the way" keeps moving. So a button, floating just
 * above the composer where the last message would be.
 *
 * It is mounted whether or not it is shown. Mounting it on demand would have it appear at full
 * opacity in its final position, which is the same picture as a layout glitch.
 *
 * Arriving and leaving are not mirror images. It rises a little on the way in, because it has come
 * from the bottom of the transcript and that is where it points. On the way out it stays put and
 * dissolves: it goes because you *arrived* at the bottom, and a button that drops away at the end
 * of a scroll reads as one last lurch downwards — the jump the button exists to save you from,
 * performed as its parting gesture.
 *
 * `pointer-events` follow visibility — an invisible button that still swallows clicks over the
 * transcript is worse than no button.
