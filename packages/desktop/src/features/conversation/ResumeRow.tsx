/**
 * The turn stopped somewhere short of the end, and here is how to pick it up.
 *
 * Pressing stop, quitting the app mid-turn, a crash, a machine going to sleep, or a model that
 * ended cleanly with items still on its own list: five ways to arrive at a conversation with
 * work left in it. Two questions follow — carry on, or do that last part again — and both are one
 * click, because retyping the request is the only alternative and it is a bad one.
 *
 * The pause used to be the one case with no answer here. Stopping is not damage, so nothing was
 * recorded and nothing was offered, and a turn you paused three seconds ago looked exactly like a
 * conversation that had finished. Getting back into it meant typing 「继续」 by hand — which is
 * the whole of what the button does, so the only thing being asked for was the typing.
 *
 * Deliberately the quietest thing on the page. It sits where the timestamps sit, in the same
 * grey at the same size: it is a footnote about what happened, not an alarm. Anything louder
 * would make an ordinary pause look like a failure.
