/**
 * Which MCP server a tool call came from.
 *
 * A run of `mcp__context7__context7__get-library-docs` in the transcript used to draw the same
 * globe as every other MCP call and as `web_fetch` — so a conversation that touched three servers
 * showed three identical rows, and the only part of a tool run a person reads without reading was
 * saying nothing.
 *
 * The lookup is the whole difficulty and the reason it is a pure function with tests of its own.
 * Names are built as `mcp__${sanitize(server.id)}__${sanitize(tool)}` and `sanitize` is not
 * reversible, so the only sound direction is forwards: sanitise every configured id and ask which
 * prefix the tool name starts with. Splitting on `__` would be wrong for the ids this app actually
 * writes — installing Context7 produces the server id `context7__context7`, whose tools are named
 * `mcp__context7__context7__…`, and the first `__` lands in the middle of the id.
 *
 * Kept free of React and of `window.plume` so a test can call it. The wiring is in `useMcpMark.ts`.
