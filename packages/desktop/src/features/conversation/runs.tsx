 * 60 `Run`s while the transcript draws in `TurnBlock`s (`grouping.ts`), and a turn can hold hundreds
 * of runs: one session had 400 tool calls between two things the user typed. Paging by row into a
 * turn like that loads 60 rows straight into an already-collapsed block, so the only thing that
 * changes on screen is the number in 「调用工具 N 个」 — four clicks in a row, and the transcript does
 * not move. Now one click always brings whole turns, so it always brings something you can see.
 *
 * Twenty rather than sixty because a turn is worth several rows: its question, its answer, and the
 * one folded line standing in for everything in between. Collapsed turns cost nothing to keep
 * mounted (`TurnProcess` renders nothing while closed), so this number is about how much a person
 * wants to take in at once, not about what the browser can hold.

 * same ids, and a group whose calls are unchanged has nothing new to draw.

 * attempts at fixing it. It is the one prop that changes *without the calls changing*: a group
 * stops being the current one the moment another begins, and stops being live the moment the turn
 * ends — and in both cases its own calls are exactly as they were. Compared on calls alone, React
 * was told nothing had changed and skipped the render, so the highlight stayed on every group that
 * had ever been the current one, and stayed lit after the turn was over.
 *
 * It also explains why this twice looked fixed when it was not: switching conversations remounts
 * these, and a fresh mount never consults a memo comparison. The failure only shows in the one
 * situation the comparison exists for — a transcript being added to in place.
 *
 * The comparison itself is `sameRun`, in `grouping.ts`, so that the tests can check the one that
 * actually runs instead of a copy of it. See the note there.
