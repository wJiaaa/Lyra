/**
 * A rule firing, shown where it happened.
 *
 * Until this existed a rule correction was invisible. Synthetic messages render as nothing, so a
 * rule that cut the model off mid-sentence and made it start again showed up as the model simply
 * having said something different — and "why did it suddenly change its mind" is exactly the
 * question a person asks afterwards, when a toast that might have explained it is long gone.
 *
 * Collapsed by default, because a rule working is not news. What is worth a click is the pair of
 * facts underneath: which rule, and **what text it caught** — a pattern written too broadly is
 * only visible next to the thing it grabbed, and that is the first thing anybody wants when a
 * rule misfires.
