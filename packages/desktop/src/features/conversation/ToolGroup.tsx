/**
 * A stretch of tool work, said in one line.
 *
 * Every run of calls looks the same here whether it is one file or nine — and that sameness is
 * the point. The transcript used to switch between two languages: a short run drew a row of
 * bordered cards, a long one collapsed to a line of grey text, and the eye had to re-learn what
 * it was looking at every few paragraphs. One form, always, reads as prose with the reply rather
 * than as furniture between paragraphs.
 *
 * The line says what was done, not how many things were done. "执行了 4 个操作" is a count of
 * events nobody witnessed; "创建 2 个文件、执行 2 条命令" is the same row of cards, read.
