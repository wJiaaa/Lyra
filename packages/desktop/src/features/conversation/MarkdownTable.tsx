/**
 * A table in a reply, and the two things it needs that the markup does not give it.
 *
 * Cells are `white-space: nowrap` — breaking 「一键新机」 across two lines to save eight pixels is
 * worse than scrolling — so a table with more columns than the reading column has pixels is wider
 * than its box. That was already true and already handled: the wrapper scrolls. What it had no way
 * of saying was that it scrolls. Native scrollbars are off everywhere (see `base.css`), so the
 * overflow was silent: a table that ended mid-word looked like a table that ended.
 *
 * So: the app's own thumb along the bottom edge, on hover, and a control that turns the nowrap off
 * for people who would rather read the whole thing at once than drag it into view. Wrapping is per
 * table and not remembered — it is a way to look at *this* one, the same as scrolling it.
