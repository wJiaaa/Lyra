/**
 * A row that opens into its own detail, as one object.
 *
 * The panels used to draw this as two things: a highlighted row, then a separate bordered box
 * floating under it at an indent that lined up with nothing. Two shapes, a seam between them, and
 * an inset borrowed from a different component's geometry — which is why it read as stuck on rather
 * than opened.
 *
 * Here the row and its detail are one shape: the row carries the top corners and the side borders,
 * the body continues them and carries the bottom ones. One border, drawn in two halves, so there is
 * no outer box whose radius has to be kept 1px apart from an inner one to stop the corners squaring
 * off — a sum that was wrong the moment either number changed.
 *
 * When it is open the row pins to the top of the panel while its own body scrolls past, so a long
 * detail never leaves you reading output with no idea which step produced it.
 *
 * The pinning is why the row sits in a wrapper it does not obviously need.
 *
 * A rounded corner is only visible when something of a different colour shows through it, and once
 * the row is pinned the thing behind its top corners is its own body — the same fill, so the corners
 * read as square and the side borders appear to run straight off the top edge. The wrapper is the
 * fix: it pins instead of the row, it is opaque in the panel's own colour, and it is square. The row
 * keeps its radius and draws inside it, so the corners show the panel through them whether the card
 * is sitting in the list or pinned halfway up its own contents.
 *
 * It cannot clip, either: `overflow: hidden` on an ancestor makes it the scroll container for
 * anything sticky inside, which would pin the row to a box exactly as tall as the row.
 *
 * And the open card is lifted above its siblings. The enter animation moves the card, which gives
 * every card a stacking context of its own for as long as the transform is retained — and a sticky
 * row inside one of those can never paint above the card that comes after it, however high its own
 * z-index. That is what made a pinned row appear to have the next row's text printed through it.
