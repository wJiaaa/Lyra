 * True only while the answer is genuinely arriving; see `answering.ts` for why that is not the same
 * question as "does this reply contain text".
 *
 * The clock is the half that cannot be derived from the messages alone. Text that has stopped
 * growing looks exactly like text that grew a moment ago — the difference is how long ago, and
 * nothing re-renders to mark the passing of time on its own. So the length is watched, and a timer
 * is set each time it changes: another chunk cancels and restarts it, silence lets it fire.
 *
 * One timer, restarted, rather than a tick that runs for the whole reply. A quarter-second interval
 * through a long answer is a wake-up several hundred times per turn to recompute a boolean that is
 * almost always the same; this fires once per stall.
