 * The card's own 「撤销」 and 「审核」 sit directly above these rows, so going for them crosses them —
 * and the preview was up before the pointer had left. It opens above the row, over the buttons, so
 * the one action this turn offers became unreachable by trying to reach it.
 *
 * And the rows are flush against each other, with the preview 8px above the one it belongs to — so
 * that 8px is the row above. Nudging up from the last file lands there, and if switching were quick
 * the whole surface would jump a row and redraw, which from the outside is the preview vanishing.
 * Switching waits exactly as long as opening does: cross that row on the way into the preview and
