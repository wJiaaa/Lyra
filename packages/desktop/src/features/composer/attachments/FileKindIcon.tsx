/**
 * The icon for a kind of file.
 *
 * One per family rather than one per extension: a `.mov` and a `.mp4` are the same thing to the
 * person looking at the list, and forty icons that differ in ways nobody can name is worse than
 * eleven that are instantly readable. Colour carries as much of it as the shape — the conventions
 * are old enough to be automatic (Word blue, Excel green, PDF red), and following them means the
 * list is scannable without reading a single filename.
