/**
 * On a phone, the files that should not ride inside the prompt go to the desktop as uploads.
 *
 * The composer reads every attachment into memory and puts its bytes into the prompt, which is right
 * on the desktop — the file is already on that disk, and the prompt goes over IPC. On a phone the
 * prompt goes over the network as one message, so a 100 MB log became a 1.3 GB WebView heap and a
 * frame the desktop refused, and anything a phone could not extract (a PDF, an archive, a video) was
 * read whole just to be attached by name. Now those are streamed to the desktop a slice at a time by
 * the bridge (`files.upload`, see `mobile/src/bridge-wire.ts`) and the prompt carries the upload's
 * id; the desktop swaps it for the path it wrote, and the agent reads the file from there.
 *
 * What stays inline is what the model is better off seeing directly and what is cheap to carry: an
 * image small enough to look at, a short text. See docs/adr/0037-sync-link-streams-large-data.md.
