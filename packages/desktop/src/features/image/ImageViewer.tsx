/**
 * The image, full size, arriving from wherever you clicked it.
 *
 * Two transforms, on two elements, for two unrelated jobs.
 *
 * The outer one is the flight. It is FLIP and it has to be, because the two states have different
 * sizes and there is no single property that gets from one to the other honestly. The final layout
 * is computed first — centred, contained within the window — and then the *first* frame is expressed
 * as a transform that lands the image exactly on the thumbnail it came from. One frame later the
 * transform is removed and the browser interpolates. Nothing is ever laid out at an intermediate
 * size, so a large picture costs the same as a small one and neither reflows on the way.
 *
 * The inner one is zoom and pan. It is a separate element because FLIP writes `style.transform`
 * directly and the two would otherwise overwrite each other. Keeping them apart also means the FLIP
 * measurement is of the settled layout box, which a child's transform does not affect — so zooming
 * in and then closing still flies back to the right thumbnail.
 *
 * Closing runs the same path backwards, and only unmounts when it finishes — an overlay that
 * disappears on the click and animates nothing is the thing this replaced.
