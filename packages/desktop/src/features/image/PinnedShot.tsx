/**
 * A screenshot left on the desktop: one picture, one close button, nothing else.
 *
 * This page is the whole of a pinned window. It is sized by the main process to the picture's own
 * dimensions before it loads, so there is no layout here to speak of — the image fills the window
 * exactly, and everything else is drawn on top of that.
 *
 * Dragging is done by hand rather than with `-webkit-app-region: drag`, and that is the one design
 * decision in the file. A drag region is handled by the window server, which means the page is not
 * told about the pointer inside it at all: no `pointermove`, and no `:hover`. The close button is
 * supposed to appear when the pointer is over the picture, so a drag region would have traded the
 * feature that was asked for against the one underneath it. Moving the window over IPC costs a
 * message per frame and keeps both.

	 * renderer that stopped answering input at all, intermittently, in the moment after a drag
	 * ended: a captured pointer inside a window that is itself chasing that pointer. A listener on
	 * the window has neither problem and needs nothing released afterwards.
	 *
	 * `screenX`/`screenY` rather than `clientX`: the window moves as the drag happens, so the
	 * pointer's position *within* it barely changes — a delta measured in client coordinates would
	 * be nearly zero and the window would go nowhere.
	 *
	 * One message per frame. A `pointermove` can arrive more often than the screen refreshes, and
	 * each one asks the main process to move a window; the extra ones cannot be seen and are work
	 * the compositor has to undo.
