/**
 * Fullscreen in-place screenshot overlay, drawn with the app's own annotator.
 *
 * Two coordinate spaces meet here and it is worth being explicit about which is which. The
 * selection and every pointer event are in CSS pixels, because that is what the overlay window is
 * measured in. The annotator works in the snapshot's own pixels, which on a Retina screen are twice
 * as many. `AnnotateCanvas` is therefore given an explicit CSS size — the display it is standing
 * on, at 1:1 — rather than being allowed to lay out at its bitmap's size, which would cover twice
 * the area it is meant to.
 *
 * The annotator is handed the *whole* snapshot, not a crop of the selection, and the selected
 * region is a window onto it: an absolutely positioned frame with the full-size canvas shifted
 * underneath it by the selection's own offset. That is what keeps marks anchored to the thing they
 * were drawn on when the selection is moved or resized afterwards — a crop would have to be
 * retaken on every drag, and every mark on it would slide.
