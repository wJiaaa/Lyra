/**
 * The app's toasts. One surface, one set of rules, mounted once.
 *
 * They used to be drawn inside `<main>`, pinned above the composer. That was fine while the only
 * thing raising one was the conversation, and wrong the moment the file panel started raising
 * them: `main` is one column of a three-column row, so a notice about a file was clipped at the
 * panel's edge, printed on the far side of the window from the tree it was about, and underneath a
 * panel that outranks it. A message saying "that move is not allowed" cannot be something the
 * window can hide.
 *
 * So: a portal to `<body>`, fixed to the window, above every other layer, centred at the top. The
 * top because it is the one band that stays clear in all four arrangements — panel closed, panel
 * beside, panel full screen, compact — and because the composer, the tree and the editor all live
 * below it. Centred because a toast raised by the panel and one raised by the conversation are the
 * same kind of thing and should not appear in two different places.
 *
 * Everything about *which* cards exist is in `stack.ts`; this file is the drawing, the clock and
 * the pointer.
