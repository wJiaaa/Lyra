/**
 * A scheduled task failed: said above the composer, until someone has seen it.
 *
 * In the conversation rather than in a corner of the window. The task ran in a session of its own
 * that nobody was looking at, and a toast would have been gone before anyone looked up. One line —
 * the newest failure, and how many others there are. 查看 opens the schedule at that task's card,
 * where the reason stays; the cross says it has been seen. Both clear the count on the sidebar too,
 * since it counts the same failures.
 *
 * Only the screen in front says it. A split window draws a composer for every screen, and the line
 * belongs to none of their conversations, so it is said once rather than beside each of them.
