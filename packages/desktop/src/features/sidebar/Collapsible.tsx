/**
 * A section that folds shut, with the fold actually animating.
 *
 * `max-height` is the usual way and it is a guess: too small clips a long list, too large makes
 * the transition finish early and the last part of the fold happen with nothing moving. A grid
 * whose single row goes from `1fr` to `0fr` interpolates against the content's real height, so a
 * project with three sessions and one with thirty both take the same time and neither is cut off.
 *
 * Collapsed content stays mounted but is taken out of the tab order — a fold is a visual state,
 * and a list nobody can see is a list nobody should be able to tab into.

	 * `overflow: hidden` is what makes the fold visible — the grid track is what shrinks, and the
	 * child has to be willing to be smaller than its content for that to show. But it is also what
	 * breaks `position: sticky` for everything inside, and a section here holds project names that
	 * are meant to pin. A project name inside a clipped section simply scrolled away with the list.
	 *
	 * An open section has nothing to clip, so it does not need to.
	 *
	 * 裁剪用 `overflow: clip` 而不是 `hidden`。`hidden` 会让这一层成为里面吸顶行的参照容器：展开动画
	 * 期间项目行要离这一层顶部 `--ly-rail` 那么远，被推到自己分组的底部，压在会话行上，动画结束解除
	 * 裁剪才跳回原位。`clip` 只裁不滚，吸顶仍然以侧边栏为参照。
	 *
	 * 代价是它不算滚动容器，网格子项的最小高度回到内容高度，`0fr` 压不下去，所以要显式 `min-h-0`。
