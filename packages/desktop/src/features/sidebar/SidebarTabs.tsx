 * Conversations used to only exist inside their project, which made the most recent one the hardest
 * thing in the pane to reach: it was under whichever project it belonged to, five rows down, past
 * however many other projects came first. A project is found by its name and a conversation is
 * found by when you last touched it, and one list cannot be ordered both ways — so there are two.
 *
 * The strip pins to the top of the list rather than living above it. It is the list's own control,
 * not the pane's, and a fixed row would have spent a third of a narrow column on it before the
 * first conversation ever appeared. `StickyLayer` is what actually holds it there.
 *
 * Same fill relationship as the settings pages' `Segmented` — `bg-card` under `bg-elevated` — so
 * the two read as the same control at two sizes. What differs is the slide: this one is switched
 * often enough that the moving fill is worth the element, and it says which way you went.
