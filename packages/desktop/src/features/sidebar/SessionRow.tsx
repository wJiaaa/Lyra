/**
 * One conversation in the sidebar.
 *
 * The row, not the button inside it, owns the hover state. The archive affordance is a sibling
 * laid over the button's right-hand end, so a pointer sitting there is outside the button —
 * hanging `hover:` on the button meant the fill and the text colour dropped out the moment you
 * reached for the icon, while the icon itself (keyed off the row) stayed.
 *
 * The title stops short of the archive button, always. It used to run the full width with the
 * icon on top of it, so a long name and the icon overlapped into something neither could be read
 * through. A gradient behind the icon was the previous answer, but the sidebar is translucent —
 * there is no colour to fade to that reliably covers text. Reserving the space costs a few
 * characters and cannot go wrong; the full title is a hover away in the scroller either way.
