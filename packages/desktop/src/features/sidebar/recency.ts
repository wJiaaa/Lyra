/**
 * Conversations ordered by when you last touched them, cut into bands.

 * The 「聊天」 half of the sidebar. Its whole reason for existing is that a project orders its
 * conversations by belonging and never by recency, so the one you were in five minutes ago can be
 * anywhere in the pane. Here it is first, always.
 *
 * A flat run of forty titles has the opposite problem — nothing in it says how far back you have
 * scrolled — so the run is banded. The bands are calendar-relative rather than a rolling window:
 * 「昨天」 has to mean yesterday, not "between 24 and 48 hours ago", or a conversation from last
 * night lands in it at breakfast and out of it by lunch without anyone touching it.
