/**
 * What a conversation row cannot say in one line, on hover.
 *
 * The row is a title and nothing else — deliberately, because in a pane 240px wide a second column
 * of names competes with the titles for the space the titles need. Everything that used to be
 * fighting for that space, and several things that were never shown at all, live here instead.
 *
 * A card rather than a tooltip. The app's tips are one string on an inverted surface, which is
 * right for 「关闭」 and wrong for four labelled figures — those want alignment, marks, and room to
 * separate the identity of the thing from the numbers about it.
 *
 * That separation is spacing alone. It was two hairlines, which at this size read as a table drawn
 * inside something the width of a business card: three rules counting the border, on 248px, around
 * two short lines and three figures. The gaps were already doing the work.
 *
 * Portalled to `<body>`: the sidebar is a scroller that clips its overflow, and a card pinned
 * beside a row would be cut off at the pane's edge — which is exactly where it needs to be.
