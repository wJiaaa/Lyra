/**
 * The strip at the bottom, whose business is the app rather than the conversation.
 *
 * Padded container, rounded row — the same shape as every other item in this pane. As a full-bleed
 * button its hover fill ran edge to edge and read as a different kind of control from the list it
 * sits under.
 *
 * The update dot rides at the end of this row, and is usually not there at all. Which is why it is
 * here rather than in the toolbar: this is the one strip of the window that is about the app
 * itself, and a row that already ends in a small round mark has somewhere to put another one.
