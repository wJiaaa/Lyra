/**
 * A row in the nav, and — for the ones that lead somewhere — whether you are there.
 *
 * Clicking these used to leave no trace: the view you had opened looked exactly like the one you
 * had not, so the only way to know where you were was to read the pane beside it. `active` is the
 * same treatment the settings nav already gives its own sections.
 *
 * Destinations sit in the muted tone and step up to full ink when current, which is what makes
 * the highlight read as "you are here" rather than as a hover that got stuck. 新对话 is not one
 * of them — it starts a conversation rather than leading anywhere, so it stays at full weight and
 * has no state to be in. `undefined` rather than `false` says that: not inactive, inapplicable.
