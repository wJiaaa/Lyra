 * How deep the pinned rows reach, so the list can be softened below them rather than through them.

 * The rows themselves are `position: sticky` and need nothing from JavaScript — the browser holds
 * them on the compositor, which is the only way they keep up with a wheel. This is the one thing
 * CSS cannot answer: where the *bottom* of the pinned band currently is, so the scroller's fade can
 * start there instead of at the top of the viewport.
 *
 * An earlier version placed the rows by hand, outside the scroller's mask, so they needed no fill
 * of their own and the translucent pane stayed translucent. It worked and it was wrong: the list
 * scrolls on the compositor and the placement ran on the main thread, so every pinned row sat one
 * wheel tick behind the list — measured at 14px of wobble on a trackpad. Pinned rows stay inside
 * the scroller now, and this number is all that is left: the mask softens below it, and the list
 * rows fade out against it before they slide under a pinned row (`ly-under-pin`), since the pinned
 * rows have no fill to hide them — the pane is translucent on macOS.
 *
 * Being a frame late here costs nothing, which is the point of the split: the rows are placed by
 * CSS and cannot lag, and a fade whose start is a few pixels stale is a gradient in a slightly
 * different place — not a row that jumps.

 * exactly there — so the strip dissolved as it approached the top, hung there as a ghost of itself,
 * and snapped back to full strength the instant it landed. The row was never the list; it only
 * looked like it because it was passing through where the list gets erased.
 *
 * So a row counts as held once it is within one fade-depth of its rail: from there the mask holds
 * it whole and softens above and below it instead. `fade` is that depth — `Scroller`'s `FADE_TOP`,
 * and zero when the scroller is at the top and nothing is being softened at all.
 *
 * `top` is where the band starts, which is what lets the list keep fading above a row that has not
 * landed yet. It is zero once anything has actually reached its rail, and the band then reaches the
 * top edge the way it always did.

/**
 * One band is not enough, and the second one is the whole of this.
 *
 * Two rows can be held at once — the strip against the top edge, a project heading on its way to
 * the rail beneath it — and between them there is *list*: rows sliding up towards the strip, which
 * are exactly the thing the fade exists for. Treating the pair as one band from the first row's top
 * to the last row's bottom protects that stretch too, and the moment the strip landed the list
 * stopped dissolving into it and started sliding under it hard-edged. Measured on a three-project
 * sidebar: the softening jumped from 44px (flush under the strip) to 108px (past a heading still
 * 33px short of its rail), and the rows in between went from faded to fully lit in one frame.
 *
 * So the rows are grouped into runs of touching held rows instead. `bottom` is the underside of the
 * run against the top of the pane, `next` is the one below it — with the gap between them left for
 * the mask to soften, which is what puts the fade back where it belongs.
 *
 * More than two runs cannot happen here: there are two rails, so at most one strip and one heading
 * can be held, and anything beyond the second run is far enough down to be ordinary list. If a
 * third rail is ever added this needs to grow a loop; the mask would need one too.
