/**
 * The navigation pane: what you can go to, and what you have been in.
 *
 * Two lists rather than one. A project orders its conversations by what they belong to and 「聊天」
 * orders every conversation by when you last touched it, and no single list can be both — which is
 * why the most recent conversation used to be one of the hardest things in the pane to find. The
 * strip that switches between them is `sidebar/SidebarTabs`, the lists are `sidebar/ProjectList`
 * and `sidebar/ChatList`. The strip and the current heading are held at the top by `position:
 * sticky`; the only part of that JavaScript owns is where the fade below them starts, which is
 * `sidebar/useStickyFade` and `sidebar/sticky.ts`.
 *
 * Only the pane itself is here. Which conversations are listed and what a row does is
 * `sidebar/useSidebarLists`; the rules underneath it are `lib/sidebar-grouping` and `sidebar/recency`.
