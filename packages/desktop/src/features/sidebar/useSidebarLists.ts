/**
 * What the sidebar is showing, and what its rows do.
 *
 * One list, two pools. The archive is the same two views over a different set of conversations —
 * grouped by project or banded by date, pinned, searched and paged in exactly the same way — so
 * swapping what goes in is the whole of it, and everything downstream is written once.
 *
 * Separated from the pane for the usual reason this codebase separates things: these are rules you
 * want to be able to state. Which conversations are listed, which pool they come from, and which
 * of the four actions a row offers are three questions with three answers, and none of them is
 * about layout.
