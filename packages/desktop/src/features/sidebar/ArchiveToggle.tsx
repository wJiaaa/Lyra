 * The way into the archive, and back out of it.
 *
 * Archiving is the sidebar's own reversible action, and until now the only way to reverse it was
 * 设置 › 已归档的聊天 — three clicks and a different pane away from the list you archived it out
 * of. This is the same collection at the place it belongs to.
 *
 * One button in one place for both directions. The archive replaces the list rather than opening
 * beside it, so the control that put you there is the one that takes you back — and it stays in
 * the same spot so leaving is not a matter of finding anything.
