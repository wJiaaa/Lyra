/**
 * The open file's name, and the whole tree behind it.
 *
 * The pane's header used to say 「文件内容」 — a label naming the pane's own category, on a pane
 * whose category is never in doubt, taking the one row that could have said *which file*. Worse,
 * that was the state the pane was most often left in: the tree is a companion that gets closed, and
 * with it gone this pane became a file with no name and no way to reach another one.
 *
 * So the name is the control. It says what is open, and — when there is no tree on screen — pressing
 * it drops the project's tree down under it. That is the same `FileTree` the panel draws, not a
 * reduced copy: expanding, collapsing, searching, renaming, the right-click menu and drag-and-drop
 * all work here because it *is* that component. Which folders are open is shared state
 * (`store/fileTree.ts`), so a tree opened here is open in the panel and the other way round.
 *
 * Only when there is no tree on screen. With the tree pane beside this one the dropdown would be a
 * second copy of a list you are already looking at, and a control that opens one is a control that
 * does nothing worth doing — so the name is just a name then. What counts as "on screen" is not
 * "open": maximising this pane on its own covers the tree, and a narrow window shows one pane at a
 * time. See `paneVisible`.
