 * bar here — a name and three buttons across the top, on a card with its own border — and it
 * announced itself twice: the page nearly always opens with its own heading, and the bar repeated
 * it above a strip of chrome that did nothing until you wanted it. Now the page is simply there,
 * and the controls surface on hover the way a message's own actions do.
 *

 * reach this window; no top-navigation, so it cannot replace the app with something else. It is
 * served from its own `ly-preview://` origin rather than `file://`, which is what keeps it from
 * walking the disk. The agent wrote this code; it is not trusted with anything but its own
