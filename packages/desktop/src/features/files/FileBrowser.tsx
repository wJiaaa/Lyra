/**
 * The project's files: the tree, and nothing else.
 *
 * Opening one hands it to the `file` pane rather than showing it here. The two used to be halves
 * of this component — a tree on the left, the file on the right, with a breakpoint that stacked
 * them and a draggable seam between them. All of that was this component reimplementing, badly and
 * for two panes only, what the dock now does for every pane: split either way, drag the boundary,
 * put one away, make one full screen.
 *
 * What the tree contains, what right-clicking it offers and what happens to a file when you rename
 * it all live in `files/`.
