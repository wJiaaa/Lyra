 * The open file, as a pane of its own.
 *
 * It used to be the right-hand half of the file browser, which meant it could only ever be beside
 * the tree, at whatever width was left over, and it disappeared the moment you put the tree away.
 * As a pane it goes wherever the file does: under the tree, across the window, full screen while
 * you read something long, or in the corner while the conversation has the room.
 *
 * All it does is choose between four states. What a file *looks like* is `FileViewer`'s problem,
 * and what is open is the store's.
