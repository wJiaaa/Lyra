/**
 * One pull request, as a row.
 *
 * Two lines, and the split between them is what makes a list of sixty scannable: the top line is
 * *what changed and when*, the bottom is *whose it is and how big*. Reading down the first line
 * answers "is any of this mine to do"; the second is there for the two or three rows where the
 * answer was yes.
 *
 * The icon is centred across both lines rather than aligned to the first. It stands for the row,
 * not for the title — pinned to the top it read as a bullet in front of the title and left the
 * second line hanging off nothing.
 *
 * Memoised on its data, which is the other half of a list that refreshes itself. The hook hands
 * back the same object for a row that did not change, so a refresh that changes one row re-renders
 * one row — and with it, one marquee measurement and one avatar lookup instead of sixty.
