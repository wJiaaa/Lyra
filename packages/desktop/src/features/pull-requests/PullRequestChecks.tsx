/**
 * Every check, not just how many passed.
 *
 * The header answers "is it green"; this answers "which one is not", which is the only question
 * anybody has once the answer to the first is no. It used to say `4 项全部通过` and stop there,
 * on the reasoning that the names were a click away on the web — but that click is the moment a
 * review tool hands you back to the browser, and the name of the one red check is the single most
 * useful string on the page.
 *
 * Ordered failures first, then pending, then passes. A list sorted the way GitHub returns it puts
 * the one thing you need somewhere in the middle of nineteen greens.
