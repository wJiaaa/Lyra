/**
 * Every face the pane has fetched, in one store it all shares.

 * for its own on mount, so scrolling a list of sixty was sixty IPC round trips, the same three
 * authors fetched over and over, and a visible flash of the fallback initial on every remount even
 * though the answer had been sitting in the main process the whole time.
 *
 * Three moves fix all of it, and none of them are about the picture:
 *
 *   - **one store, module-scoped**, so the answer outlives the component that asked;
 *   - **one request per frame**, since a list arrives all at once and thirty names in one call is
 *     one round trip instead of thirty;
 *   - **kept in `localStorage`**, so the second launch draws the faces in the first frame rather
 *     than a beat later. They are a few KB each and they do not change.
