 * have been opened, and which rows you have already looked at. None of it is authoritative — it
 * exists so that opening this screen costs nothing, and so that a refresh replaces something
 * readable rather than a spinner.
 *
 * `localStorage` rather than a file through IPC: no more authoritative than a browser's
 * back-forward cache, and it should cost nothing to write. Versioned in the key, so a change to
 * the row shape retires the old entry instead of half-rendering it — and validated on the way out
 * as well, because a version bump only protects against the changes somebody remembered to bump
 * for. A stored value from yesterday crashing the pane today has happened here once already.
