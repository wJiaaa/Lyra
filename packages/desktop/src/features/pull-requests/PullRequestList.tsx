/**
 * The list of pull requests, grouped by why each one is there.
 *
 * A flat list sorted by date answers "what changed recently", which is not the question. The
 * question is "what is waiting on me" — so the groups are the relations, in the order they need
 * attention, and the filter above is the same three answers stated as a choice.
 *
 * Each group folds. Two of the three are usually background — what you already reviewed, what you
 * are waiting on — and a heading you can close is what lets somebody make this pane about the one
 * bucket they came for without losing the others. The state is kept, because it is a preference
 * about how you work rather than about this visit.
