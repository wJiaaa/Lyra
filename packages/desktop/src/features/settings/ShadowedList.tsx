/**
 * The same-name conflicts on a settings page, with the two things the list alone could not do.
 *
 * Listing who shadowed whom answers "why is the one I wrote not running". It does not answer the
 * question that follows — "which one should I keep?" — and that one needs the difference in
 * front of you and a way to act on it without opening either file. So each row can unfold into
 * a diff (winner first, so the pluses are what switching would add), and 「改用那个」 writes the
 * preference and then says where it wrote it: a change nobody can find later is a change they
 * cannot undo.
 *
 * Shared by rules and skills because the relation is the same; the callbacks come from the page,
 * which is also what lets this mount in a test with nothing behind it.
