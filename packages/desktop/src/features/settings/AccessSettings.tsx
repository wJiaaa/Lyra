/**
 * The two lists that decide what gets asked and what gets refused.
 *
 * Both exist because of the same idea: a prompt that fires constantly stops being a safeguard.
 * So the app asks less — and the price of asking less is that the answers it stops asking for
 * have to be visible and revocable somewhere. This is that somewhere.
 *
 * **Always-allowed** is what you said yes to permanently. Until now it could only grow: every
 * 「始终允许」 added a line nobody could ever see again, which is a permission granted and then
 * lost track of.
 *
 * **Internal hosts** is the other direction. Private addresses are refused outright rather than
 * asked about, because a prompt showing `169.254.169.254` is a question almost nobody can answer
 * correctly. Somebody who really does run a service on their own network needs a way to say so,
 * and it should be a decision made here, deliberately, rather than one made under a prompt in the
 * middle of a turn.
