/**
 * What the QR code says, and how to say it for each way of reaching this desktop.
 *
 * Three routes, and the phone cannot work out which one it is on: a LAN address, a public name
 * that a proxy or port forward routes here, and a relay both sides dial out to. They differ in
 * scheme, in port, and in whether a host is even the right question — so the code carries the
 * answer rather than making the phone guess and retry.
 *
 * Kept apart from the component that renders it because the mobile app parses the same string. A
 * format defined inside a React component is a format that gets adjusted when the layout changes.
