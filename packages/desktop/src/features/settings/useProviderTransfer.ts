/**
 * The provider list leaving as a file, and coming back as one.
 *
 * Separate from `useProviders` because it is a different question. That file is "what does editing
 * a provider mean"; this one is "what does it mean to carry the whole list to another machine" —
 * and its consequences are its own: a download that is worth stealing, and a file whose contents
 * this program did not write.
 *
 * Nothing is written to settings until the plan has been shown and confirmed. `planImport` works
 * out what each entry would do, the modal shows it, and only the entries that come back from there
 * are merged.
