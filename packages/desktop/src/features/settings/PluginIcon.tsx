/**
 * A bundle's mark.
 *
 * Its own icon when it shipped one, and a mark saying what kind of thing it is when it did not.
 *
 * Three things stood here before. First the initial letter — a wall of lettered tiles is a wall of
 * squares you have to read, and `A` tells you nothing about AgentFlow that the word beside it did
 * not. Then a glyph guessed from the name on a colour hashed from the same name, which is better to
 * look at and worse to trust: it is *generated identity*, a plausible-looking mark that was never
 * chosen by anyone, and telling nine of them apart trains the eye on shapes that mean nothing. Then
 * one shared picture for everything without an icon, which was honest and said the same sentence to
 * a page of MCP servers, a page of plugins and a page of skills — all of which already knew what
 * they were looking at.
 *
 * What is here now says the one thing the app actually knows about a bundle with no icon: which of
 * the three kinds it is. That is a fact read off its contents, not a guess, and it is the same fact
 * the page is sorted by — so the mark agrees with the heading above it instead of competing with it.
 *
 * `brandColour` tints it when the entry declared one. That is not the hashed colour this replaced:
 * a hashed colour is invented here, a declared one was chosen by whoever published the entry and is
 * as much a part of what they shipped as the name. Where none was declared the mark stays grey,
 * which is the difference — nothing is being made up to fill the gap.
