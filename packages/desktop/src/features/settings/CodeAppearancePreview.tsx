/**
 * What code will look like, under every setting on this page.
 *
 * It carries the typography as well as the palette, because those are the settings people actually
 * hesitate over — a weight or a line height is not something anyone can picture from a number, and
 * a preview that ignored them showed the same specimen whatever you moved.
 *
 * Three rules follow from where it sits, which is in the middle of a settings page:
 *
 *   - Its height is fixed. It is a *specimen*, and one that grows when you widen the leading pushes
 *     the very controls you are reaching for down the page — you move a control, the row moves out
 *     from under the pointer, and the effect you were judging is buried under the movement it
 *     caused. Whatever does not fit scrolls, on this app's own thumb.
 *   - You type straight into it. There used to be a pencil button that switched the box into an
 *     edit mode, which is a step asking permission for something that should just be true: the
 *     stock three lines answer "how does this look" and not "how does *my* code look", which is
 *     the question anyone choosing a mono face is actually asking.
 *   - What you type stays highlighted. The old edit mode dropped the colours, so the moment the
 *     specimen became yours it stopped showing you the thing you came to compare — which is the
 *     palette. A transparent textarea sits over a coloured render of the same text, both set with
 *     the same metrics, so the caret is real and the colours are real.
