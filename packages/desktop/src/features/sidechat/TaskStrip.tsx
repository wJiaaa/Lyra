/**
 * What the side chat has handed over, and where it got to.
 *
 * The side chat cannot act on the project itself, so anything that needs doing is dispatched to the
 * main session's queue. This is the receipt for that — one line per task, in a panel two hundred
 * pixels wide, which is the constraint that decides everything below.
 *
 * No fill, no border, no expander. It had all three: a rule above it, a tinted background, a
 * summary row that collapsed the list, and a card with its own border and its own spinner sitting
 * under the spinner that was already in the summary. Two spinners for one fact. The text is
 * truncated to a line and the whole of it is a tooltip, which is what a narrow panel can afford.
