/**
 * Which pages this browser panel gives a `<webview>` to.
 *
 * A page lives in exactly one place, because a `<webview>` moved or re-created is a page reloaded —
 * its scroll, its form, whatever the agent had done in it. So each page has one host:
 *
 * - A detached browser window hosts its own conversation's pages.
 * - A screen hosts its own conversation's pages, whether its browser panel is open or not. Every
 *   screen's panel is mounted, hidden when closed, so closing it and opening it again shows the
 *   page that was already running rather than loading it again.
 * - Pages of conversations that are on no screen but still have to stay loaded — the few looked at
 *   most recently, anything an agent is driving — are hosted by the screen that has been on screen
 *   longest (`host`).
 *
 * Nothing here depends on the focus. There used to be a window-level browser as well, and pages
 * were handed between it and a screen's according to which screen had the focus — a reload on
 * every click between two screens. After that, a screen closing its panel handed its pages to the
 * host and took them back on reopening — a reload each way, and the form typed into was gone.
 *
 * A screen counts from the moment it has been measured (`sizes`), on both sides of the rule at
 * once: before that its pages stay with the host, so no page is ever drawn in two places.
