 * rebuild the transcript, the composer or the panels. Those subscribe here, and this component's
 * props do not change while a boundary moves.
 *
 * Every screen is the same thing whatever the count: this conversation and the panels it owns,
 * drawn by the conversation's own dock. A single screen is a split of one — there is no window
 * layer above it that panels could fall into. The title bar is handed to that dock so it covers the
