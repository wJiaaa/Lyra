/**
 * Which of the four 代码外观 settings the terminal follows.
 *
 * Font and size: yes. A face chosen for the editor should be the face in the shell beside
 * it, and 「用于文件预览、代码编辑器与终端的等宽字体」 is what the setting promises.
 *
 * Line height and tracking: no. Those are reading settings — a fenced block in prose sits at 1.6
 * so the eye can track along a line, and someone who has pushed it to 2.3 and the tracking to
 * 0.09em for their eyes has, without meaning to, made every terminal cell 28px tall with a pixel
 * of air after each glyph. That is what a prompt with three lines of nothing between its lines
 * was, and the block cursor the size of a stamp: one cell, at that height. A terminal is a grid,
 * every terminal on the machine draws its grid at about 1.2 with no extra tracking, and the
 * programs that draw boxes and progress bars in it are designed for exactly that.
