/**
 * A real shell, in the panel.
 *
 * A pseudo-terminal rather than a command runner: the difference is whether the program on the
 * other end believes it is talking to a person. Without a pty there is no colour, no prompt
 * redraw, no Ctrl-C, and anything full-screen — an editor, a pager, an interactive installer —
 * is simply unusable. Those are most of the reasons to want a terminal at all.
 *
 * The shell is not owned here. It lives in the main process, and this connects to whichever one this
 * pane has selected — each terminal is its own tab of the dock, see `scope.ts`. So this component
 * mounting is not a terminal starting, and it unmounting is not one ending — see
 * `electron/terminal-registry.ts`.
 *
 * Nor is it owned by the project. Everything in here used to be keyed by the current directory, so
 * changing projects tore the terminal down and built another, and leaving every project left the
 * pane blank — while the shells carried on running where nobody could reach them. The project
 * decides one thing only: where a shell starts when you ask for a new one.
