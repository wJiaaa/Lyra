 * redraw, no Ctrl-C, and anything full-screen — an editor, a pager, an interactive installer —
 * is simply unusable. Those are most of the reasons to want a terminal at all.
 *
 * The shell is not owned here. It lives in the main process, and this connects to whichever one the
 * tab strip has selected. So this component mounting is not a terminal starting, and it unmounting
 * is not one ending — see `electron/terminal-registry.ts`.
 *
 * Nor is it owned by the project. Everything in here used to be keyed by the current directory, so
 * changing projects tore the terminal down and built another, and leaving every project left the
 * pane blank — while the shells carried on running where nobody could reach them. The project
 * decides one thing only: where a shell starts when you ask for a new one.
