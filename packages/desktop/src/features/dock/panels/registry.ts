/**
 * Which panels the side panel can show.
 *
 * The list was a literal inside the component and a matching `if` chain further down, which meant
 * adding a panel touched both and nothing else could add one at all. Here each panel is a record —
 * label, icon, shortcut, when it is unavailable, and what to render — so the component only has to
 * loop, and a plugin can contribute one by registering it.
 *
 * `availability` is a predicate over the app state rather than a boolean, because whether a panel
 * can open changes while the app runs: the terminal needs a workspace, the side chat needs a
 * conversation, and both arrive after the panel list is first built.

	 *   The open file is the one — see `file-panel-handoff.ts`, and the `fileState` argument to
	 *   `windows:openPanel`.
	 * - `"none"`: it cannot go. The browser is the one: a `<webview>` belongs to the document that
	 *   created it, so "the same page" in another window is a fresh navigation — scroll, forms and
	 *   anything the page was holding are gone. Offering the button and then losing their work is
	 *   worse than not offering it.
