/**
 * The tree, flattened into rectangles.
 *
 * This exists to solve one problem, and it is the problem that decides whether the whole dock is
 * usable: **a pane must never be unmounted by a rearrangement.**
 *
 * Rendering the tree recursively is the obvious approach and it is wrong. React reconciles by
 * position, so a pane that moves from one branch to another is a different element at a different
 * depth — it gets unmounted and remounted. For most panels that would only lose a scroll position.
 * For the terminal it kills the shell and its scrollback; for the browser it reloads the page. The
 * old panel already knew this, which is why it kept every tab mounted and merely hid the ones
 * behind, and switching tabs makes the same promise.
 *
 * So the tree is never rendered. It is *measured*: turned into a flat list of boxes in fractions
 * of the dock, and the panes are drawn as one flat, stable list positioned absolutely. React sees
 * the same elements in the same order no matter how the layout changes, and what moves is CSS —
 * which is also what makes the rearrangement animate for free.
