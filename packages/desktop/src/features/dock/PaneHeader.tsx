/**
 * A pane's title bar: what it is, and the things you can do to it.
 *
 * **Only the grip moves the pane.** The grip is a short bar near the top edge, and it is both the
 * only way to move the pane and the only thing that says the pane can be moved. One small target
 * meaning exactly one thing beats a large one meaning several.
 *
 * It fades in as the pointer comes into the pane rather than sitting there permanently — a mark
 * that is always visible on every pane is five marks competing for attention in a window where
 * nothing is being moved. Keyed to the *pane* because the bar it sits on cannot answer: a
 * `drag-region` gets its mouse events taken by the window manager, so `:hover` there never fires.
 *
 * **Everything else moves the window.** That falls out of the first rule rather than competing
 * with it: with the pane's drag confined to the grip, the rest of the bar is free to be what a
 * title bar normally is. Losing this is what made the window undraggable for a while — the dock
 * reaches the top edge now, so if these bars do not move the window, nothing up there does.
 *
 * `drag-region` on the bar, `no-drag` on everything you can press. Electron composites the two by
 * walking the document in order, so the holes have to come after the region they are cut out of —
 * which is the order they appear in below.
 *
 * No border under it. The panes are cards with their own edges, and a rule here would draw a
 * second line a few pixels inside the first.

			 *
			 * Centred on the *pane*, which is why it is a child of the header rather than of the
			 * title's box. It lived in that box for a while and was centred within it, and the
			 * middle of "whatever the buttons left over" is visibly left of the middle of the card —
			 * by half the actions' width, so the more buttons a panel has the further off it sits.
			 * Here, `left: 50%` resolves against the header's padding box, which spans the card
			 * regardless of what the two paddings are reserving for traffic lights or captions.
			 *
			 * What made centring on the header unworkable before was drawing the mark level with
			 * the title: on a 300px right-edge pane, where Windows reserves ~138px for its caption
			 * buttons, the middle of the header is on top of full-screen and close. The top edge
			 * settles that — at `GRIP_TOP` the mark is above the row the buttons sit in, so the two
			 * cannot collide even when they do line up, and the actions keep their own layer
			 * (`z-[1]` below) so a press still reaches the button rather than the grip.
			 *
			 * Absolute also keeps it out of the row's flow: a long title would otherwise push it
			 * off centre, and the one thing a handle must do is be in the same place every time.
			 *
			 * A real button, not a decoration, because it carries the keyboard route too. Dragging
			 * is the whole interaction here and a drag is one of the few gestures with no keyboard
			 * equivalent at all; without this the dock would be unusable without a mouse. Focused
			 * arrows preview a destination, Enter commits, and Escape cancels. Alt+arrows preserve
			 * the immediate edge-move shortcut.
			 *
			 * `touch-none` so a trackpad drag moves the pane instead of scrolling what is under it;
			 * without it the browser claims the gesture before the first move arrives.
