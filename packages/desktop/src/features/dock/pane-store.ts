/**
 * 面板布局——每个会话一份，而且只有这一份。
 *
 * 面板（终端、浏览器、文件、Git、任务……）属于会话，不属于窗口。窗口里只有会话的网格：单屏是
 * 只有一屏的分屏，每一屏画的都是「这个会话的对话 + 它自己的面板」。所以这里的每棵树都挂在一个
 * scope 下，scope 就是那一屏的会话 id（空白对话是 `@draft`）。
 *
 * 从前有两层都能装面板：窗口一层跨着所有屏，每一屏又各有一层。两层之间靠一串特例对齐——「已经在
 * 窗口层的留在那儿」「分屏时窗口层冻结在进入分屏的那个会话」「浏览器页面按焦点在两层之间交接」——
 * 每条修一个症状，又在别处埋一个：任务面板分屏后横跨两屏、回到单屏的面板压在标题栏下面、打开
 * 网址冒出第二个浏览器、切一次焦点页面重载一次。架构决定见 `docs/adr/0023-containers-belong-to-sessions.md`。
 *
 * 这个文件只管数据：树、全屏、窄窗口时正显示哪一块、拖动中的临时状态。画成什么样是 `DockView` 的事。
