/**
 * Picking a pane up, carrying it, and putting it down.
 *
 * Three decisions define how this feels, and all three are here:
 *
 * **The layout rearranges live.** The tree is committed the moment the pointer crosses into a new
 * landing region, not on release — so what you are looking at while you drag is the layout you
 * will get, not a hint about it. Committing on region changes rather than per frame is what makes
 * that affordable: a terminal re-measures itself once per region crossed instead of sixty times a
 * second.
 *
 * **The hit test reads the tree, never the DOM.** The panes are mid-transition for most of a drag,
 * so `getBoundingClientRect` would answer with wherever they happen to have got to — and the
 * landing region would be computed from a position that is already stale. The tree is authoritative
 * and costs nothing to measure.
 *
 * **The pane itself is what lifts.** Not a stand-in card that follows the pointer — that reads as
 * cheap, because it is: an empty rectangle with a title, while the thing you are actually moving
 * sits greyed out underneath. A pane *is* its contents, and the only way to carry those without
 * mounting a second copy — a second shell, a second page — is to move the one that exists. So the
 * pane switches from `absolute` in the dock to `fixed` against the window and back, which changes
 * no element and recreates nothing.
