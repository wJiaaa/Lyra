/**
 * One conversation's screen: its transcript and the panels it has open, arranged by its own tree.
 *
 * Every screen is drawn by this — a single screen is a split of one. There is no window-level dock
 * any more: a panel belongs to the conversation it was opened for, sits inside that conversation's
 * screen at the screen's full height, and goes wherever the conversation goes. The screen's title
 * bar (`header`) covers the transcript only, never a panel beside it. See
 * `docs/adr/0023-containers-belong-to-sessions.md` for the two-layer arrangement this replaced.
 *
 * Two rules hold this together, and both exist to keep a pane's contents alive across a
 * rearrangement — a terminal's shell, a page in the browser, an editor's undo history.
 *
 * **One flat list of panes, positioned absolutely.** Never a recursive render of the tree; see the
 * note at the top of `layout.ts`.
 *
 * **One DOM shape for every window size.** The narrow form is the same panes, each laid over the
 * whole screen with all but one hidden — not a different component. A layout that swaps its
 * structure at a breakpoint unmounts everything inside it.
