/**
 * What the sync row and the empty state say, given where the checkout stands.
 *
 * Written as data rather than as JSX because the interesting part is the table, not the markup:
 * eight situations, each with a different answer for two buttons and a sentence, and several of
 * them (a stopped rebase, a repository whose remote is called something other than `origin`, a
 * branch the remote has never seen) are tedious to reach in a running app and trivial to write
 * down here. The component below renders whatever this returns and decides nothing.
 *
 * The rule the whole thing serves: a button is emphasised only when pressing it is the next thing
 * to do. Everything else is either muted — available, not urgent — or disabled with a reason.
 * Four identically grey icons is what the panel had before, and it is why nobody could tell that a
 * commit was sitting unpushed.
