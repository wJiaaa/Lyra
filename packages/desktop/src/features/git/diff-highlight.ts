/**
 * Syntax colours for a diff, on top of the change colours rather than instead of them.
 *
 * The two are different questions about the same line — "what kind of code is this" and "did it
 * change" — and they have a channel each: the glyphs carry syntax, the row's tint and rail carry
 * the change. Painting a whole added line green answers the second question twice and the first
 * one not at all, which is how a review ends up being read as three colours of prose.
 *
 * Each hunk is parsed as two passages rather than line by line. A removed line belongs to the
 * old file and an added one to the new, so reassembling each side and parsing it whole is what
 * lets a block comment or a template literal keep its colour across the lines it spans — the
 * case that per-line parsing always gets wrong.
