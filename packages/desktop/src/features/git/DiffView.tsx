/**
 * Unified diff: a gutter of line numbers, a green rail on additions and a red rail on removals,
 * and the code itself syntax-coloured underneath both.
 *
 * The two colour systems answer different questions and do not compete — the row's tint and rail
 * say whether a line changed, the glyphs say what the line is. This used to paint whole added
 * lines green and whole removed lines red, which said "changed" a second time in the one channel
 * that could have carried syntax, and left a review to be read as three colours of prose. The
 * tint alone already marks the change; nothing is lost by letting the text mean something else.
 *
 * Long lines scroll sideways, and that is the whole reason for the layering here. The rows sit
 * on a layer as wide as the longest line, so a tint or a separator runs the full length of what
 * it belongs to instead of stopping at the fold. The line numbers and the rail are pinned to the
 * left edge, because the moment a line is long enough to need scrolling is the moment you most
 * want to know which line you are on. Everything that is metadata rather than code — the hunk
 * headers, the truncation notice — is pinned as well, since scrolling it away helps nobody.
