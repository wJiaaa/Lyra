/**
 * How much is uncommitted, always in view.

 * The agent edits files. The one thing you need to keep track of while it does — and the thing
 * that is easiest to lose track of — is how much has piled up that you have not looked at.
 * Having to open a panel to find out makes it something you ask about; sitting here, it is
 * something you notice.
 *
 * Both controls open the Git panel rather than acting here. Committing used to happen in a
 * popover hanging off this row, which could only ever stage everything and record it blind —
 * there was nowhere in it to see what was going in. Reviewing and committing are one motion, so
 * they belong in the one place that can show both.
