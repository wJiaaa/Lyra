/**
 * The model, as it appears in a composer row.
 *
 * One component because there is one thing being shown. The main composer, the side chat and
 * anything else that grows a field later are all the same question — "what will answer this?" —
 * and an answer that looks different in each place reads as three different questions.
 *
 * Not `ModelSelect`, which is the form control the settings pages use. That one is a bordered box
 * sized like a text field, which is right in a settings row and wrong in a composer: the field
 * already has a border, and a second one inside it draws a box around one control out of five.
 * The side chat used it for a while and that is exactly how it looked.
 *
 * A mark and a name, and everything else in the tooltip. Where the model is inherited rather than
 * chosen, `inheriting` says so there — on screen it was a second label in the row saying 「随主
 * 会话」, which is a sentence about configuration in a place meant for writing a message.
