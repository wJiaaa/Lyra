/**
 * The reasoning level as a small meter, for a phone's composer.
 *
 * The desktop says the level in words beside the model's name — 中, Medium, Средняя — and a word is
 * as wide as its language makes it: 「中」 is one glyph, "Очень высокая" is thirteen letters. On a
 * phone the row has no width to give it. In English "Medium" left the model's name at
 * `Claude Sonn…` on a 390pt screen, and in Russian it was worse, so what the row showed depended on
 * the language rather than on the model.
 *
 * A meter is the same width in every language and still says what the word said: how far along
 * its model's own scale this conversation is set — one bar per level the model offers, lit up to
 * the chosen one, the same scale the menu's slider draws. The word is one tap away, at the top of
 * that menu, and it stays the button's accessible name.
