/**
 * Formatting a file, without needing a toolchain installed for it.
 *
 * Prettier's standalone build, which is the same engine the command line runs but with no file
 * system and no plugin resolution — you hand it the source, the parser and the parser's plugins,
 * and it hands back text. That constraint is the reason for the table below: the plugins have to
 * be named ahead of time rather than discovered, so every language we format is an entry here.
 *
 * Loaded on demand. The parsers are large — the TypeScript one alone is most of a megabyte — and
 * the overwhelming majority of sessions never format a Vue file, so paying for all of them at
 * startup would slow every launch for a feature used by some of them. Once loaded they stay
 * loaded, since the second Go file is very likely to follow the first.
 *
 * Languages with a canonical external formatter (gofmt, rustfmt, black) are deliberately *not*
 * here. Prettier has plugins for some of them, but a Go file formatted by anything other than
 * gofmt is wrong in a way Go programmers can see at a glance — those run in the main process
 * against the real binary. See `electron/format-external.ts`.
