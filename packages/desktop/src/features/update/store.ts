 * only thing drawing an update. It is not any more: 设置 → 关于 shows the same version, the same
 * download and the same buttons, and the moment there were two of them the hook meant two of
 * everything — two six-hourly checks, two `onProgress` subscriptions, and two copies of `info`
 * that drift apart the instant one of them rechecks. Two surfaces disagreeing about which version
 * is available is not a rendering bug anyone would find by reading either component.
 *
 * So the state is module-level and the components subscribe. `phase` is not really owned here at
 * all — it belongs to the main process, and this is a cache of what it last said.
