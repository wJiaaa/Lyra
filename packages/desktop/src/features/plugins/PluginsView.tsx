/**
 * The catalogue: what you could have, and what you already do.
 *
 * This is the browsing half of a subject that has two halves. It answers "what is out there and
 * what did I install" — a page of marks and one-line descriptions, laid out to be skimmed. The
 * other half is 设置, which answers "what is this one doing": switches, versions, parameters,
 * where its directory is. The sidebar used to go straight there, which meant the first question
 * had nowhere to be asked. The gear in the header is the way from here to there, and it points
 * at whichever settings tab matches the tab you are on.
 *
 * Three tabs, because there are three things and they are not interchangeable: a plugin is a
 * bundle of skills, an MCP server is a program that gets started, and a skill is a page of
 * instructions. They used to share one tab called 插件, which is how seven MCP servers came to be
 * listed, installed and described as plugins — and then failed to appear on the MCP settings page,
 * because that page reads the settings file and these had been written somewhere else.
 *
 * Its header lives in the window's own 44px strip, level with the sidebar's controls, the same
 * way the pull request view does — see `PullRequestList` for why `no-drag` sits on the controls
 * and never on the row.
