/**
 * Everything the catalogue can show, from the three places it comes from.
 *
 * A bundle reaches this window down one of two paths: it was cloned from a registry, or somebody
 * put a directory in `~/.plume/plugins`. Those are different facts about the same kind of thing,
 * and the page is not a good place to keep them apart — a card wants to say "this is Chrome, it
 * controls the browser, and you have it" without first asking which list it came out of.
 *
 * What it does have to keep apart is *what* the thing is. A plugin is a bundle of skills; an MCP
 * bundle is a server declaration that happened to arrive in a git repository. They install
 * differently (one lands on disk, the other also writes into settings), they are switched on
 * differently (one flag, versus one per server), and the catalogue used to call both of them
 * "插件" — which is how a page of nine entries came to be seven MCP servers wearing the wrong
 * word. `kind` is that distinction, read off the contents rather than taken on trust.
 *
 * The three sources are merged on `id`, once, and what comes out carries every half: `installed`
 * for a plugin on disk, `bundle` + `servers` for an MCP server on disk, `entry` for what a
 * registry says it is.
