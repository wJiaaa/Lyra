/**
 * One bundle in the catalogue.
 *
 * A card with a border, which it did not used to have: it was a row that grew a background on
 * hover, and a grid of those reads as a list of links rather than as a shelf of things. The border
 * is what makes the icon, the name and the lines under it belong to each other — and it is what the
 * site's own catalogue has always done, so the two views of one registry now agree.
 *
 * What it says has grown for a plainer reason: the data was already there. `version`, `author`,
 * `downloads`, `skillCount` and `clients` have been in every index the platform serves since it
 * existed, and this card drew a name and a sentence. See `CardMeta` for what the two lines are for.
 *
 * The actions stay minimal, and the rule is unchanged — one obvious thing, everything else behind
 * the ⋯:
 *
 *   - not installed — 安装. It is why the page exists, so it is stated rather than revealed on
 *     hover, because a button you have to find is a button most people do not.
 *   - installed — the switch, and ⋯ for the rest.
 *   - installed and superseded — 更新 as well, because that is now the one obvious thing. It is
 *     the only control here that appears on its own evidence rather than on a state the user set.
