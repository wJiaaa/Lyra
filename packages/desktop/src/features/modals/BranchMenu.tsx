		 * during that time: the answer is a branch name in the bar below and a different set of
		 * changes in the Git panel, both of which are somewhere else.
		 *
		 * The acknowledgement is a *loading state*, not the new name. Writing the target in
		 * optimistically was faster to read but dishonest when the switch was refused — and it is
		 * refused often, for ordinary reasons: uncommitted work in the way, a remote ref that
		 * cannot be checked out by that name. The chip then said `plugins` for a moment and
