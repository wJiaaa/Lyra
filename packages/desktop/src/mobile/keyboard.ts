/**
 * Keeping the composer above the on-screen keyboard.
 *
 * A phone keyboard does not resize the window. It slides over it, and the page is never told —
 * `window.innerHeight` is the same number before and after, so a composer pinned to the bottom of
 * the layout ends up pinned underneath the keyboard, with the caret in a field nobody can see. The
 * only thing that does notice is `visualViewport`, which reports the part of the window still
 * actually visible.
 *
 * So the height of the covered strip is computed from that and published as a CSS variable, and the
 * shell reserves it. Written as a function of the viewport rather than as an effect because the
 * arithmetic has a handful of cases that are awkward to reproduce in a real browser and trivial to
 * state here: a keyboard dismissed by scrolling, a viewport pushed up rather than shortened, and
 * the small shifts that are not keyboards at all and must not be mistaken for one.
