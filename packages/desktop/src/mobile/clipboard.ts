/**
 * Copying, on a phone.
 *
 * Two ways into the clipboard are used across the app and neither worked on a phone:
 *
 * - `navigator.clipboard.writeText` — every copy button (a message, a code block, a path). The phone
 *   loads this interface over plain HTTP from the desktop on the same network, and a page served that
 *   way is not a secure context, which is exactly where browsers leave the Clipboard API out. Each of
 *   those buttons threw a TypeError and did nothing.
 * - `bridge.clipboard.write` / `read` — the contract's names, used by the field menu, the file
 *   panel, the attachment menu. The phone's bridge answers the same thing as `writeText` /
 *   `readText`, so the contract's names fell through to its floor and resolved to nothing.
 *
 * Both are filled from the native side's text clipboard (expo-clipboard, see `desk.tsx`), and only
 * where they are missing: a page that has the real ones — the desktop, or a phone reached over HTTPS —
 * keeps them. Images stay unsupported; the native side only carries text.
