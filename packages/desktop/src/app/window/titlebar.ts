 * in the document, not measurable from it, and different at each end depending on which system it
 * is. Everything this app puts in that row has to be told to stay clear:
 *
 *   macOS    traffic lights at the left, a fixed width, gone in native full screen
 *   Windows  minimise/maximise/close at the right, width set by display scaling
 *   Linux    the same overlay as Windows when the desktop draws one — at either end, as it is set
 *
 * Only macOS was ever handled. Everywhere else the window wore macOS's geometry: 78px held open at
 * the left for lights that are not there, so the sidebar toggle floated out of line with the marks
 * below it, and nothing at all at the right, where the system's own buttons sat on top of the
 * panel controls — drawn, and impossible to press, because the press went to the window manager.
 *
 * Kept apart from `layout.tsx` so the rule can be read and tested on its own; the hook there is
 * the part that subscribes to the overlay changing.
