/**
 * Window-size driven layout modes.
 *
 * The window can be dragged from full screen down to 380pt, and the shell has to change shape
 * along the way rather than just squeezing. Three modes:
 *
 *   wide     ≥1180  sidebar pushes the content; the dock has room for panes side by side
 *   regular  ≥760   sidebar still pushes; the dock is tighter but still divides
 *   compact  <760   sidebar becomes a full-window drawer; the dock shows one pane at a time
 *
 * The mode lives in one place so behaviour (drawer vs push) and styling (paddings, card
 * columns) can never disagree — a phone-shaped window wearing desktop paddings was the
 * failure this replaces. `data-layout` is mirrored onto <html> for the few rules that are
 * easier to express in CSS than in props.
