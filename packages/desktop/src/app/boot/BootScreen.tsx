 * Two reasons, and the first is correctness. Packaged, the renderer is loaded with `loadFile`,
 * so the page's origin is `file://` — and `img-src 'self'` in the Content-Security-Policy does
 * not reliably cover a file-origin document. A data URL is covered explicitly by `data:` in that
 * same policy, which makes this the one form guaranteed to work both packaged and in dev.
 *
 * The second is that this is the first thing drawn. A separate request means the layout can
 * appear before the artwork does, and a boot screen that flashes its own empty frame is worse
 * than one that waits. Arriving with the bundle means it is never late.
