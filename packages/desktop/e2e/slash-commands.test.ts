/**
 * Typing a slash, in the real window.
 *
 * Everything here is about the composer's behaviour under the keyboard, which is the half of this
 * feature that cannot be checked any other way: the loader has unit tests, but "does the list open,
 * filter, move under the arrow keys, and put the right text in the field" is a claim about a
 * textarea, a floating panel and their event handling together.
 *
 * The command files are written into the profile before launch — one under `.plume`, one under
 * `.claude` — because the compatibility claim is worth holding to the same standard as the rest:
 * a file somebody wrote for Claude Code has to show up here without being touched.
