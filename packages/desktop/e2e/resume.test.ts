/**
 * A turn that loses its connection, and what the window says while it gets it back.
 *
 * The unit tests prove the countdown formats correctly and that the continuation calls `run` again.
 * Neither can prove the thing that was actually broken, because the bug lived in the seams: a
 * notice that said "1 秒后重试" and then sat unchanged for a minute, a number that restarted
 * underneath the user, and — after `agent_end` had already stood the window down — an idle screen
 * for the whole resume wait, which reads as a turn that died.
 *
 * So: a real model that really drops the socket mid-reply, the real IPC path, the real React tree,
 * and a sampler watching the line while it happens.
