/**
 * The highlight on a run of tool work, across the boundary between two turns.
 *
 * The unit tests decide which run `runs` marks; what they cannot show is the thing that was
 * reported — a line still gliding on screen minutes after the work it describes finished, through
 * the whole of a reply that never touched a tool. That is a claim about frames of a live app: the
 * real store, the real memo boundaries, the real CSS class. A finished run that React was never
 * told about looks exactly like a finished run that was, until you watch one.
 *
 * So: one turn of tool work, then a question answered in prose, sampled while it is answered.
