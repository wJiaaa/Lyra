/**
 * The row along the bottom of the composer, at every width it has to survive.
 *
 * Two reported faults, one cause. The context meter and the words beside the access mark were
 * dropped at fixed field widths — 480px and 420px — and a width cannot answer "does this fit",
 * because what fits depends on how long the model's name is. So the meter went while the row still
 * had 54px of clear air in it, and dropping it freed width that nothing then claimed.
 *
 * The other half of it is the overlap. Both groups were `shrink`, and everything inside the left
 * one is `shrink-0` — so flex squeezed the left *box* to 73px while its contents stayed 124px wide
 * and hung out over the model chip. Nothing was drawn on top of anything; the box was simply
 * narrower than what was in it, which looks exactly the same.
 *
 * Widths here are imposed on the field directly rather than by resizing the window. Below about
 * 760px the shell folds its sidebar away and the composer gets *wider*, so the narrow cases are
 * not reachable from the window at all — and they are the ones this is about.
