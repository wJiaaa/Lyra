/**
 * A stretch of tool work, as it is actually drawn while it happens.

 * The grouping rules have unit tests, and they prove the rows are right for a given transcript.
 * What they cannot prove is the thing that was wrong: that the row a call lands in while the
 * reply is still streaming is the row it ends up in. That is a claim about consecutive frames of
 * a live turn, so it needs a live turn — a real model stream, the real IPC path, the real React
 * tree — and a sampler watching the DOM while it runs.
 *
 * The model is a local server speaking Anthropic's wire format, so this costs nothing, needs no
