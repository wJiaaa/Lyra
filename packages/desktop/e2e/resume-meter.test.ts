/**
 * What the running line says about a turn that was paused and picked back up.
 *
 * Pressing stop and then 继续 is one piece of work with a gap in it. It was reported as two: the
 * meter was thrown away when the turn ended and lit again from zero when the next message went out,
 * so a task that ran for minutes and was paused once reported the length of its second leg — and
 * the tokens of its second leg, which makes the tokens-per-second a rate for work nobody did.
 *
 * The arithmetic is unit-tested in `turn-meter.test.ts`. What cannot be unit-tested is the wiring:
 * the meter is written in three places that each used to overwrite the others — the composer when it
 * sends, `agent_start` when it arrives two seconds later, and the per-session map that keeps the
 * clocks of conversations you are not watching. The fault lived in the seam between them, so this
 * drives the real buttons through the real event stream and reads the number off the screen.
