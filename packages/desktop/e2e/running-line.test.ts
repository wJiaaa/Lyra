/**
 * Whether the window ever stops saying it is working while it is still working.
 *
 * The running line folds away once the answer itself is streaming in, which is right: prose
 * arriving on screen is a better progress report than a phrase about progress. What it must not do
 * is fold away and *stay* folded while the turn goes on without it — the composer's stop button is
 * still spinning, so the two halves of the window disagree about whether anything is happening, and
 * the half that is easier to see is the one that is wrong.
 *
 * Two ways to reach that, both of them ordinary:
 *
 *   1. A reply that says a sentence and then calls a tool. That is one assistant message holding
 *      `[text, toolCall]`, not two messages — so a test that models it as two never sees it.
 *   2. A reply that says a sentence and then goes quiet: a slow provider, a long think between
 *      paragraphs. Nothing arrives, nothing changes, and nothing says the turn is still alive.
 *
 * The model here does both, and hangs in each state so the window can be read while it is in it.
