 * Starting the real app, and talking to the window it opens.
 *
 * Driven over the DevTools protocol rather than through a test framework: Electron already speaks
 * it, so this needs no driver, no browser download and no second way of describing a click.
 *
 * Shared by every end-to-end test, because "boot it and wait for the shell" has three failure
 * modes that each took a while to work out — a preview server that outlives the process you
 * killed, a window that exists before React has mounted into it, and a start that fails with no
 * explanation unless you kept what the app printed. Solving those once is the point of this file.
 *
 * One app at a time: `test:e2e` passes `--test-concurrency=1`. Each file here starts a real
 * Electron process, and three of them competing for a laptop produced timing failures in tests
 * that measure layout — which is the worst kind of red, since the code under test was fine.
