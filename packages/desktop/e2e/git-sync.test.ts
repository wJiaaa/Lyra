/**
 * The sync row and the empty state, in the app, against a real repository.
 *
 * The rules have unit tests and they cover the table. What they cannot cover is whether any of it
 * is wired up: whether the panel reads the state it was given, whether pressing 「发布分支」 pushes,
 * and — the part that has broken before — whether the screen notices afterwards. Publishing changes
 * no file, so a panel comparing readings on file lists alone would go on offering to publish a
 * branch that had just been published.
 *
 * The remote is a bare repository next to the project, so this needs no network and no credentials.
