/**
 * The update badge and dialog, driven through a real download of the real release.
 *
 * Not a test — `node e2e/update-shot.ts` — and it is here rather than in `*.test.ts` because it
 * needs the network and a published release, which a test suite must not. What it is for is the
 * half of this feature that only exists once it is on screen: whether the ring actually closes,
 * whether pausing looks paused, whether closing the dialog leaves the badge still counting, and
 * whether there is a way back in after the announcement has been waved off.
 *
 * It walks the phases in order and photographs each one, so the sequence can be reviewed as a
 * sequence. The caller is expected to have dropped `packages/desktop/package.json` to an older
 * version first — `app.getVersion()` reads that file, and an app that is already the latest
 * version has, correctly, nothing to show.
