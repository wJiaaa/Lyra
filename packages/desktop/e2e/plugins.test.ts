/**
 * The plugins page in a real window: what it draws, and what uninstalling actually removes.
 *
 * The unit tests own the rules — where a bundle lands, what its id is, which settings rows it
 * writes. What they cannot see is the half that only exists once there is a window: whether a card
 * appears for something on disk, whether the uninstall in the ⋯ menu reaches the same code the
 * tests call, and whether a page of bundles without their own icons draws marks you can tell apart.
 *
 * That last one is why the icon assertion is here rather than in a unit test. "Every card came back
 * with the same GitHub avatar on it" is not a property of any function — it was a property of the
 * page, produced by a registry that answers with the repository owner's face for anything that
 * shipped no icon, and by a monorepo that makes seven products share one owner. It could only be
 * seen by looking.
 *
 * Uninstalling is driven through the actual menu rather than through `window.lyra`, because the
 * question is whether *the button* works. Everything it touches — the directory, the settings file
 * — is then read off the disk, not off the screen.
 *
 * Installing cannot be reached the same way, and the reason is worth writing down: the 安装 button
 * only exists on a card that came from a registry, a registry index must be https, and standing up
 * an HTTPS server a test process will trust is a great deal of machinery for a button. So that one
 * is driven by calling the same IPC the button calls — which still crosses the process boundary,
 * still clones, still writes settings, and still has to show up on the page afterwards.
