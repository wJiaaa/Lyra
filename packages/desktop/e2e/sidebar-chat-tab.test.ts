/**
 * 「聊天」 as a statement about what you are doing, not only about what you are looking at.
 *
 * The two halves of the sidebar list the same conversations two ways, and switching between them
 * is normally just a way of looking. On a window with nothing open it is more than that: it is the
 * only thing said so far about what happens next, and the composer used to ignore it — 「聊天」 over
 * an empty list still asked which project to pick, and 新对话 from there opened a directory picker
 * on a fresh install with no project to pick.
 *
 * The other half of the rule is what must *not* happen: a conversation that exists is never taken
 * out of its project by a glance at the recent list.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the interface — clicking the strip, reading the chip above the
 * composer — because the claim is about what the window says and does, not about which fields the
 * store happens to hold.
