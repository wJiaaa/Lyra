/**
 * The orb at the head of a running turn: that it draws, and that it draws the right thing.
 *
 * The unit tests prove which mood a tool maps to. They cannot prove any of what actually goes
 * wrong with a canvas component in Electron — that it mounts at all, that it paints something
 * rather than staying a blank 20×20 box, that it is legible on both themes, and that it stops when
 * the turn does. Those need a real window with a real turn running in it, which is this.
 *
 * Pixels rather than class names throughout. A canvas has no DOM to assert on: the only honest
 * evidence that an animation is running is that the bytes change between two frames, and the only
 * honest evidence that it suits a theme is the ink being lighter than the pane on dark and darker
 * on light.
