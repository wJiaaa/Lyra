 * row of identical tray icons, most of which belong to processes with no window and therefore
 * answer nothing; underneath it is two schedulers firing the same task, two sync servers on one
 * port, and two processes appending to the same session log.
 *
 * What is checked here is the whole of the fix: a second launch on the same profile exits by
