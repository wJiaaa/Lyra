/**
 * The branch lines in Git 历史, where a commit has been expanded.
 *
 * `node --experimental-strip-types e2e/git-graph-probe.ts [dir]`
 *
 * The reported defect: expanding a commit inserts a diff list tens to hundreds of pixels tall, and
 * the topology lines — which were only ever drawn inside the 46px commit row — stopped at the top
 * of that block and resumed below it, leaving a gap the height of the expansion.
 *
 * So the measurement is geometric, not structural: it is not enough that a line element exists,
 * it has to actually span the expanded block. A `height="100%"` SVG in a flex row is exactly the
 * kind of thing that renders as zero when the parent's height is not resolved, so that is the
 * thing worth checking.
