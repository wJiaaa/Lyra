 * The PATH repair, in the real app, launched the way a double-click launches it.
 *
 * Not a test: it needs the app started with a deliberately crippled `PATH`, which is the one thing
 * `startApp` inherits from whoever runs it, and it reads the process tree rather than the window.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types packages/desktop/e2e/gui-path-probe.ts
 *
 * The unit tests prove `primeCommandPath` works. They cannot prove anything calls it — and "the
 * code is there, the feature is not" has happened sixteen times in this repository. So this looks
 * for the one externally visible thing that call does: a login shell, spawned by the main process,
 * during startup.
 *
 * Run as a pair, because the absence is as much of a claim as the presence:
 *   - launched with launchd's PATH  → the shell is asked
 *   - launched with a real PATH     → it is not, and startup pays nothing
