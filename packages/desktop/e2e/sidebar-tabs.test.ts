/**
 * The sidebar's two lists, pinned for real.
 *
 * Everything here measures boxes and reads computed style. Nothing asserts on a class name, and
 * nothing reads the store — the claim under test is "the strip stays at the top and the list goes
 * under it", and the only honest evidence for that is where things are and how much of them is
 * being drawn.
 *
 * The rows are held by `position: sticky`, so where they sit is the browser's job and not worth
 * asserting. What is worth asserting is everything around it: that the fade starts under them
 * rather than through them, that a row being pushed out cannot surface above the strip, and — the
 * one that cost the most to learn — that a pinned row does not move while the list scrolls under
 * it. An earlier version placed these by hand from `scroll` events and lagged the compositor by a
 * frame, which is a row visibly jumping a wheel tick at a time.
