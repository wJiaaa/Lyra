/**
 * The pull request list, in a real window.
 *
 * The unit tests own the rules — what is grouped where, what counts as changed, what counts as
 * unread. What they cannot see is the half of this feature that only exists once it is laid out:
 * whether the icon is actually in the middle of the row it stands for, whether a group really
 * folds to nothing, and whether a refresh that changed nothing leaves the DOM alone.
 *
 * That last one is the reason this file exists. "Unchanged rows keep their object" is a claim
 * about React, and the only honest evidence for it is that the elements on screen are the same
 * elements afterwards — a memo that silently stops working looks identical in every other way,
 * and would quietly put a full re-render of the list on a 45-second timer.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts on the *contents* of a row. The seeded accounts point at hosts that cannot
 * resolve, so the list is always the seeded cache — which is also what a real machine shows while
 * a host is unreachable, and is the one state that does not depend on somebody's token.
