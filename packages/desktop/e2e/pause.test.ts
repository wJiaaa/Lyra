/**
 * Pressing stop, and what the conversation offers once you have.
 *
 * The unit tests prove `howItStopped` reads an aborted tail correctly. They cannot prove the thing
 * that was actually broken, because it lived in the seams: the state that decides whether anything
 * is offered was computed when a session was *opened*, so a turn paused in the conversation you
 * were already sitting in left the window with nothing to say. The transcript looked finished, and
 * getting back in meant typing 「继续」 by hand.
 *
 * So: a real model that really streams, the real stop button, the real IPC path, and the real React
 * tree — checked before the pause as well as after it, because a row that offers to resume a turn
 * that is still running would be worse than one that never appears.
