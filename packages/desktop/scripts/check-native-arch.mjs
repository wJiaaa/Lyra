/**
 * Whether each packaged build carries native binaries for the machine it is meant to run on.
 *
 * This exists because 0.8.35 shipped an arm64 Windows installer whose `koffi.node` was x64, and
 * nothing anywhere said so. The build succeeded, the app launched, and the mismatch could only be
 * met by running the Windows sandbox path on an arm64 machine — which is to say, by a user.
 *
 * **How it happened.** Prebuilt native modules ship one package per platform, and pnpm installs
 * only the one the installing machine needs. Every release job packages architectures that machine
 * is not: the Windows runner is x64 and builds x64 *and* arm64. `node-pty` escapes this by being
 * compiled rather than downloaded — electron-builder rebuilds it for the architecture being
 * packaged, and the arm64 installer's `pty.node` was correctly arm64. `koffi` is downloaded, so it
 * was whatever the runner needed. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now installs every platform's copy; this
 * checks that the right one actually arrived in the build.
 *
 * Run after packaging, on whatever `release/` holds — see `package.mjs`. A failure here is a
 * release that must not go out.
