 * stylesheet Tailwind has already inlined the `@import` and the file no longer identifies itself
 * as KaTeX's. Here the filenames still do.

				 * as a module — so a build made on macOS carries `koffi-darwin-arm64` into the
				 * Windows package, where the sandbox that depends on it cannot load. External, it
				 * resolves at runtime on the machine that is actually running.
				 *
				 * The `@koromix/*` pattern is the same rule reaching one level further. `koffi`
				 * does not contain the binary itself — it requires whichever of four
				 * `@koromix/koffi-<platform>` packages matches the machine, and naming only the
				 * parent leaves the bundler to follow that require into all four. It then tries to
				 * read a `.node` binary as source and stops with 「stream did not contain valid
				 * UTF-8」, four times over. Latent until something in `electron/` changes, because
				 * until then the main bundle is served from cache and never re-resolved.

				 * Listed here rather than left to the plugin because assigning `external`
				 * replaces what the plugin contributes instead of adding to it.
