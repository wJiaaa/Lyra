/**
 * A rendezvous for two sockets that cannot reach each other.
 *
 * Both the desktop and the phone dial *out* to this, which is the entire point: an outbound
 * connection needs no port forward, so it works from behind the kind of NAT that has nothing to
 * forward. This process joins the two and copies bytes between them.
 *
 * It is deliberately ignorant. The room is a SHA-256 of the pairing token and the token itself is
 * never sent here, so this knows that two clients want to meet and neither who they are nor what
 * they say. Frames are relayed without being parsed. That is not confidentiality — this sits in
 * the plaintext path and can read the frames — it is only the absence of any reason to. Real
 * TLS protects the two network hops, but the relay operator can read and inject frames. The room
 * itself is a bearer capability on this transport, so a relay must be trusted.
 *
 * Frames are streamed, not collected: a frame's header is forwarded as soon as it is read and its
 * payload follows chunk by chunk, so a 100 MB message costs this process a socket buffer rather than
 * 100 MB. See docs/adr/0037-sync-link-streams-large-data.md for why the relay changed from
 * "decode whole frames up to 8 MiB" to this.
 *
 * No dependencies, one file, Node 18.17+. `node server.mjs`, `PORT` to move it.
