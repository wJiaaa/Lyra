/**
 * What the phone is allowed to send.
 *
 * `sync-rpc.ts` used one helper for this: `s(value)`, which turns anything that is not a string
 * into `""`. That is not validation, it is coercion — a number, an object or a null arrives as an
 * empty string and travels on into the session store, which then looks up a session called "".
 * The failure surfaces somewhere else entirely, as a missing session rather than a bad request.
 *
 * These inputs come off a WebSocket. Everything else in this application is called by our own
 * renderer, where a wrong type is a bug we would have caught compiling; here it is whatever was on
 * the wire. That is the whole reason this file exists and `ipc-types.ts` does not need an
 * equivalent.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-written rather than a schema library. Nineteen methods, and the checks are all
 * "is it a string", "is it one of these three", "is it under a sane length" — a dependency would
 * carry more than it saves, and this file has to stay importable from a package that depends on
 * nothing (see the package's README).
