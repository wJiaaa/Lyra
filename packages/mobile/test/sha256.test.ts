/**
 * The hand-written SHA-256, checked against the real one.
 *
 * It exists because the WebView has no `crypto.subtle` — the page is served over plain HTTP, which
 * is not a secure context — and pulling in a native module for one hash means keeping its version
 * in step with whatever Expo Go ships. Sixty lines of arithmetic instead, which is only acceptable
 * if it is actually right.
 *
 * `node:crypto` is the oracle. The interesting inputs are the ones near the padding boundaries: a
 * block is 64 bytes and the padding needs 9 of them, so 55, 56 and 64 bytes are where an
 * off-by-one first shows, and every one of them looks fine on a short string.
