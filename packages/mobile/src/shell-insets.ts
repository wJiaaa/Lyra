 * — it knows which of its parts are background and which are buttons — but it cannot measure the
 * chrome itself. `env(safe-area-inset-*)` answers inside WKWebView and answers zero in most
 * Android WebViews, so the numbers come from here, where `react-native-safe-area-context` has them
 * for both platforms, and the page reads them as `--ly-native-*` with `env()` as the fallback.
