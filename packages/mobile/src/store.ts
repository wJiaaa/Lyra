 * the phone's own conversation screen needed to draw. That screen is gone: the phone now shows the
 * desktop's own interface in a WebView, and that interface keeps its own state exactly as it does
 * on a desktop. Modelling any of it a second time here would be two answers to the same question.
 *
 * What is left is the address, and it is persisted because being asked to scan a code every launch
 * is not a security measure, it is an annoyance. `SecureStore` is the keychain: the token in here
 * opens a paired desktop, so it does not belong in ordinary preferences.
