/**
 * SHA-256, in plain JavaScript, for working out which relay room to join.
 *
 * Written out rather than imported because neither obvious source is available here. `crypto.subtle`
 * needs a secure context, and the page this pairs with is served over plain HTTP from a machine on
 * the local network — so inside the WebView it is simply absent. A native module would work, but
 * pulling one in for a single hash means a version of it that has to match whatever Expo Go ships,
 * which is a recurring cost for sixty lines of arithmetic.
 *
 * Computed on this side and inlined into the injected bridge, so the page never needs it at all.
 *
 * Not a general-purpose implementation: it takes a string, returns lowercase hex, and is used on
 * pairing tokens — short, ASCII, and not secret from the person holding the phone. It is checked
 * against `node:crypto` on the vectors that matter, including the ones that exercise the padding
 * boundaries where a hand-written implementation goes wrong.
