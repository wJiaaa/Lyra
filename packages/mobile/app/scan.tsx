 * at and one line of state, and the state is the part that matters: a scan that has been read but
 * not yet verified looks identical to one that has not been read at all, and holding a phone at a
 * screen wondering whether it worked is the failure this replaces.
 *
 * Verification happens here rather than after: a code can be scanned perfectly and still name a
 * desktop this phone cannot reach — wrong network, service stopped, the address that belonged to a
 * VPN. Finding that out on this screen means the camera is still up and the next attempt is a
 * movement of the wrist.
