/**

 * things a WebView cannot work out for itself: where to load from, what `window.plume` is, and how
 * to sit inside a phone's chrome.
 *
 * The WebView runs edge to edge and the page keeps its own controls clear of the notch and the
 * home indicator. It used to be the other way round — the insets were padding around the WebView —
 * which left a band of flat colour under every screen: the drawer stopped short of the bottom, its
 * scrim did not reach the status bar, and nothing could scroll under the home indicator the way it
 * does in every other app. Only the page knows which of its parts are background and which are
 * buttons, so the numbers are handed to it (`shell-insets.ts`) and it spends them.
