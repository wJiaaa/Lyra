/**
 * Text a person reads, written in one language, in a program that offers seven.
 *
 * The interface language setting used to move the menus and leave everything else where it was: the
 * settings page said "Mobile sync" in the sidebar and 「移动端同步」 in the page. There was no
 * mechanism behind the translations — a `t()` call happened where somebody remembered one, and the
 * next component written did not. Memory is not a mechanism, so this is.
 *
 * What counts as a finding: a string literal or a piece of JSX text containing Han characters or
 * Chinese punctuation, in the renderer's source. Comments do not — this codebase reasons in Chinese in
 * its comments on purpose, and that is writing for the people who maintain it rather than for the
 * people using it.
 *
 * The main process is read as well. It writes its own share of what people read — notifications,
 * the notices the scheduler puts up, the errors the file tree, the pull request panel and the update
 * dialog show — and it is where 「已完成」 went on being hardcoded long after the renderer had
 * stopped. Its logs are the exception, for the reason comments are: a `console.*` call is written
 * for whoever is debugging, so what it is passed is not a finding.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-i18n.mjs             # 报告，非零退出表示有新增
 *   node scripts/check-i18n.mjs --list      # 把每一条打出来，改的时候看
 *   node scripts/check-i18n.mjs --update    # 把当前状况写回基线（只允许变小）
 *   node scripts/check-i18n.mjs --rebase    # 脚本认得更多了，重新记账（允许变大）
 *
 * The baseline is a count per file, not a list of strings: a list would have to be regenerated on
 * every rewording and would turn into a file nobody reads. A count catches the two things that
 * matter — a new file that hardcodes, and an old one that grows — and cannot be satisfied by moving
 * a string from one line to another.

 * Where Chinese is the content rather than the interface.

 * `i18n/messages` is the translations themselves — the one place the words are supposed to be in
 * seven languages at once.
 *
 * `release-notes` writes the changelog, and its `lang` is the language of the *release* — the user
 * picks it in the release panel with a control of its own, separately from the interface. Wiring it
 * to the window's language would mean an English window could no longer publish Chinese notes,
 * which is the whole point of that control.
 *
 * `markdown/inline` holds one CJK *character range* inside a regular expression — the check that
 * decides where a bare URL ends. Those are code points, not words, and the scanner has no way to
 * tell a range apart from a string without lexing regex literals, which is a lot of machinery for
 * one line.
 *
 * `locales` is the same thing for the interface language, down to the single-character mark each
 * one is drawn with — 「中」, 「繁」, 「日」. Those are the writing systems naming themselves.
 *
 * `commit-language` is a list of languages, each written in itself — 「简体中文」, 「日本語」,
 * 「Русский」. That is how a language picker is supposed to read, and translating an entry would
 * make it name a language in a language its speaker may not read.
 *
 * `electron/i18n.ts` is the main process's catalog, both languages in one file — exempt for the
 * same reason `i18n/messages` is.
 *
 * Nothing else belongs here. Other text going *to* a model would qualify on the same reasoning —
 * the language a prompt is written in is a property of the prompt — but the renderer has none of
 * it; what looked like it (`lib/thinking-words`) is the phrase beside the timer, which is exactly
 * the kind of thing a person reads.
