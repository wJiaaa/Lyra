A standalone agent with its own model settings, as an Electron desktop app.

This is not a shell around Claude Code or Codex. The agent loop, tools, skills, and MCP are implemented here. You bring the models, plugins, and skills.

## Download

Installers live on [Releases](https://github.com/wJiaaa/Plume/releases/latest). Every release includes every OS and architecture. Pick the file for this machine:

| OS | Architecture | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Apple silicon | `Plume-<version>-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS | Intel | `Plume-<version>-x64.dmg` |
| Windows | x64 | `Plume-<version>-x64.exe` |
| Windows | Arm (Snapdragon laptops, Surface Pro X) | `Plume-<version>-arm64.exe` |
| Linux | x64 | `Plume-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` or `Plume-<version>-amd64.deb` |
| Linux | arm64 (Raspberry Pi, Ampere, a Linux VM on a Mac) | `Plume-<version>-arm64.AppImage` or `Plume-<version>-arm64.deb` |

If you are not sure which architecture you have: on macOS look at the chip line in About This Mac, on Windows look at System type under Settings → System → About, on Linux run `uname -m` (`x86_64` is x64, `aarch64` is arm64).

AppImage or deb, not both. AppImage needs no installer: `chmod +x` and run it on any distribution. The `.deb` is for Debian and Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ./Plume-<version>-amd64.deb`.

Four other files are usually not what you want. The two `.zip` files are macOS archives of the same app. `Plume-<version>.exe` is a combined Windows installer for x64 and arm64, about 230 MB; the per-arch installers are about 110 MB each, so use those if you know the architecture. `SHA256SUMS` is the digest list.

## First launch

The packages are not signed with a paid certificate, so each OS blocks the first open. The way through is different on each one.

### First open on macOS

The published build is ad-hoc signed. There is no Apple Developer certificate and no notarization. A double-click hits Gatekeeper: "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." Two ways through:

- Open System Settings → Privacy & Security, click Open Anyway, and confirm with your password. (Right-click → Open no longer gets past Gatekeeper since macOS 15.)
- Or drop the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Plume.app
```

If the dialog says the app is damaged rather than unverified, that is a 0.6.0 or earlier build. Those were unsigned. Gatekeeper treats the bundle as broken, and the only option is the Trash. Install a later version.

### Screenshots go black after a macOS update

Screenshots use the system Screen Recording permission. Ad-hoc signing produces a different signature on every build, so after an update macOS sometimes no longer treats this as the same app. The entry is still listed under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording, but the capture is black or fails outright.

Clear this app's record so it can ask again:

```bash
tccutil reset ScreenCapture dev.plume.app
```

Then fully quit Plume (⌘Q; closing the window is not enough) and open it again. The next screenshot should prompt. If it does not, turn Plume off and on under Screen Recording, or remove the row with the minus button.

`dev.plume.app` is Plume's bundle id. Leave it in. `tccutil reset ScreenCapture` without it clears Screen Recording for every app on the machine.

### First open on Windows

The Windows installer is also unsigned. The first run hits SmartScreen: "Windows protected your PC." Click More info, then Run anyway.

If the wizard finishes, "Run Plume" is checked, and you get "missing shortcut / Windows is looking for Plume.exe" (or the Start menu and desktop icons do the same), `Plume.exe` did not stay in the install folder. The usual cause is Microsoft Defender quarantining a large unsigned binary. Check Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Protection history, allow the entry, and run the installer again.

The installed app is always named `Plume.exe` and is a couple of hundred MB. If the install folder also has `Plume-<version>-<arch>.exe`, about 100 MB, that is the installer itself, not the app. That happens when the destination folder is the folder the installer was downloaded into. `Uninstall Plume.exe` is a few hundred KB and only uninstalls. Neither of those launches the app.

## Add a model first

Plume does not ship a model, so the first launch cannot send a message. Open Settings → Models, add a provider (Base URL, API format, API Key), then add at least one model. The API format is **Responses**, **Anthropic Messages** or **Chat Completions**, whichever the provider documents.

## What it does

- **Your models.** Any number of providers, any number of models on each. Only **Responses** (`/v1/responses`) and **Anthropic Messages** (`/v1/messages`).
- **20 built-in tools**, in the groups the code uses:
  - Files and code: `read` `write` `edit` `ls` `glob` `grep` `symbol` `lsp`
  - Commands: `bash` `bash_output`
  - Session and memory: `todo_write` `task` `skill` `recall` `learn` `ask_user`
  - Network and preview: `web_fetch` `web_search` `preview`
- **Skills.** `SKILL.md` plus YAML frontmatter. Only the name and description enter the system prompt. The body is injected when the model calls `skill`, so dozens of skills do not burn the context window.
- **MCP.** stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE. Tools are named `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, so they never collide with built-ins.
- **Sub-agents.** `task` hands work to an agent with its own context window and brings back the conclusion. Seven built-ins: `general` `explore` `review` `verify` `plan` `simple` `reason`. Add more with `.plume/agents/*.md`.
- **Side chat.** A temporary conversation beside the current session. It can read the main chat. It writes nothing into it. Work that needs tools is queued on the main session.
- **Right-hand dock.** Nine panes, all open at once if you want: Files, File contents, Terminal, Git, Side chat, Sub-agents, Tasks, Trace, Browser. The file pane is a read-only, syntax-highlighted preview. The terminal is a real pty.
- **Split workspace.** Keep up to four conversations side-by-side in one window. Each conversation slot owns its tools dock (at least 420 px for chat, 300 px for tools), and panels render squeezed rather than unexpectedly detaching into floating windows when narrow.
- **Centered Git commit modal & branch workflows.** Commit changes through a focused dialog styled after the composer with matching border radius, breathing room, and in-place branch switching/creation. Changes support toggling between flat list and hierarchical tree view with persistent preference.
- **Replies render what the model wrote.** User bubbles and assistant text render clean Markdown. A `mermaid` fence becomes a diagram. A path to a local file becomes a one-line chip with the filename; the full path sits on the tooltip. Side chat separates model-bound attachment payloads from display bubbles and edit inputs.
- **Keep the computer awake while a task runs.** A switch in General settings. Closing the lid still sleeps.

## Layout

```
packages/
  core/              agent kernel: providers, loop, tools, skills, MCP, session store
  cli/               runs one task without a window, for evaluation; uses the desktop's settings
  desktop/           Electron app (main process + preload + React renderer)
  contract/          the line between the two processes; 221 methods in one place
  registry-shared/   plugin catalog index format, shared by desktop and the catalog service
```

`core` is platform-neutral; the desktop main process drives its `AgentSession`. A set of boundary rules governs which package may import which. `pnpm arch` enforces them. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Run from source

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Without a window

For evaluation runs: one task in, the answer out, no questions asked. It is the same runtime reading the same `~/.plume`, so models, keys, permissions, MCP servers and skills are set up once, in the desktop app.

```bash
pnpm cli -C ~/code/my-project "make the failing test pass"
pnpm cli -C ~/code/my-project --json "/review src/a.ts"    # commands and skills work as in the composer
```

The answer goes to stdout and progress to stderr; `--json` prints `status`, `answer`, `error`, `sessionId` and `usage` instead. Anything that needs approval is refused, so set the permission mode in the desktop app to what the run may do. Exit code 0 means the task finished, 1 that it did not, 2 a usage or settings problem. The run is saved as an ordinary session, which the desktop app can open.

## Where things live

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.plume/settings.json` | providers, models, MCP, permission mode |
| `~/.plume/credentials.json` | API keys, encrypted. The key material is `~/.plume/vault.key` |
| `~/.plume/sessions/` | session logs (JSONL, one record per line) |
| `~/.plume/skills/`, `plugins/`, `commands/` | user-level skills, plugins, slash commands |
| `~/.plume/memory.json` | what the `learn` tool wrote down |
| `<project>/.plume/skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `plugins/` | the same set at project level, preferred over user-level |
| `<project>/PLUME.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | project instructions, first file that exists in that order |

Moving machines is a copy of `~/.plume`. Copy `credentials.json` and `vault.key` together, or the keys will not open.

## Extensions

How plugins, skills, MCP, and sub-agents are laid out, and how the browser, the index, and hooks work:

- [Extending Plume](docs/guide/extending.md): plugin directories, `SKILL.md`, MCP servers, sub-agent definitions
- [Built-in capabilities](docs/guide/capabilities.md): the browser and its boundary, the index, hooks
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md): package graph, the boundary rules, decision records

A plugin is a bundle of skills. It does not contain MCP servers. A directory that only has `.mcp.json` is an MCP server, not a plugin. The catalog lists them separately. Installing an MCP server writes its declaration into Settings → MCP, which is the one place on the machine for every MCP server, whether you typed it or installed it.

## Appearance

Every control under Settings → Appearance actually changes the UI, by overriding CSS variables:

- Theme: system / light / dark, with a preview. Light is a full theme, not a fallback.
- Three colors are exposed (accent, background, foreground). The rest of the scale is derived from the contrast slider, so any background still has readable text and visible borders.
- UI font / code font / UI size / code size / translucent sidebar / pointer cursor / font smoothing
- Reduce motion: system / on / off
- Diff marks: color or `+/-` (for color-vision deficiency)

## System prompt

```
identity (one sentence)
Guidelines:           how to talk and work, true for the whole session
Boundaries:           lines that must not be crossed
Environment:          platform, shell, whether this is a git repo, model
<available_skills>    name / description / directory, no body
<available_subagents> name / description / tools, only when `task` is loaded
<project_context>     AGENTS.md and the other project files, wrapped in XML
Current working directory: …
```

What matters:

- Tools are not listed in the prompt. How to use a tool is written once, in that tool's `description`, which goes out with the provider's tool schema — a tool that is not loaded leaves nothing behind.
- What never changes comes first and what changes per machine, project or session comes later, so the cached prefix is as long as it can be.
- Skills list name, description, and directory. The body arrives when the model calls `skill`.
- The sub-agent list is required. Without it the model does not know the values of `subagent_type`, and a request for `explore` falls back to `general` (measured).
- `<` and `&` in a skill description are escaped, so a hostile `description` cannot close an XML tag and inject instructions.

`packages/core/test/system-prompt.test.ts` covers each of those.

## Panes

The right-hand dock is a tab strip. Nine panes can stay open:

| Pane | Shortcut | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Files | ⌘P | File tree. Clicking a file opens File contents |
| File contents | ⌥⌘P | Read-only, syntax-highlighted preview. The title is the file name, not "File contents" |
| Terminal | ⌃` | A real pty, not echoed commands |
| Git | ⌘⇧R | Workspace diff (flat or tree view), centered commit modal with branch switching & creation |
| Side chat | ⌥⌘S | See above |
| Sub-agents | ⌥⌘A | What each `task` worker is doing |
| Tasks | ⌘J | The current todo list |
| Trace | ⌘L | What this turn actually sent the model: tools, skills, injected context |
| Browser | ⌘T | Built-in browser. Boundary in [Built-in capabilities](docs/guide/capabilities.md) |

- **Width is draggable.** Sidebar and pane edges drag, double-click restores the default, arrow keys nudge. Widths persist.
- **Split layout & screen capacity.** A window can host up to four tiled conversations side-by-side. Each conversation slot owns its tools dock (at least 420 px for chat and 300 px for panels). If the workspace becomes narrow, panels are drawn squeezed rather than unexpectedly detaching into orphaned windows.
- **Full screen.** A pane can fill the conversation column. Files then becomes tree on the left and file on the right. If the sidebar is collapsed, the window buttons move into the tab strip instead of floating on the pane.
- **File preview.** Read-only. Syntax highlight, find (⌘F), wrap toggle (off by default), both scrollbars. The scrollbars paint over the content and take no width.

## Context use

A ring to the left of the model name in the composer shows how much of the model's context window this chat occupies. Click it for the breakdown:

```
Context window           12.5k / 128.0k (10%)
■ Messages                8.6k    6.7%
■ Built-in tools          2.5k    2.0%
■ System prompt           1.5k    1.2%
□ Remaining             115.5k   90.2%
```

A single total only says you are running out. The breakdown says what to do: start a new chat, turn off an MCP server, or delete a `CLAUDE.md` nobody is reading. The numbers come from the last reply's real usage, not an estimate. Past 80% the ring turns red, because the runtime starts summarizing the oldest messages around that point.

## Motion

Anything that changes on screen has a matching motion, 140 to 260ms, gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- **Sidebar.** `margin-left` slides from 0 to the negative of the current width, with a fade. The collapse control stays at the top-left of the window (to the right of the traffic lights) and does not travel with the sidebar. The fill inside the icon is the current state. ⌘B toggles.
- **Tool running.** The card border turns blue, the icon pulses, a stopwatch and spinner sit on the right, a progress rail travels along the bottom.
- **Tool done.** The status icon and `+N −M` counts pop in with a short overshoot.
- **Waiting on the model.** A thin arc sweeps a faint track, with elapsed time and token count beside it. Monochrome, because the reply sits next to it. In queued or multi-turn chats, status indicators attach accurately to the latest user bubble.
- **Approval sheet.** Slides up from the composer.
- **Message actions & Markdown rendering.** User bubbles render full Markdown with inline code and tables. Internal attachment markers intended for models are filtered out from side-chat bubbles and edit drafts. Time and copy appear only while the pointer is on that message, without changing the line height.
- **Buttons.** Hover changes color, press is `scale(0.9)`. Suggestion cards lift 2px on hover.

## Permissions

Three modes, switched from the lower-left of the composer:

- **Ask for approval**: ask on every write, command, and network call
- **Auto approve**: read-only commands (`git status`, `ls`, `grep`…) go through; the rest still ask
- **Full access**: everything goes through

"Always allow" entries are stored in `settings.json` under `alwaysAllow`.

## Session log format

Each session is an append-only JSONL file. Every record has a monotonically increasing `seq`:

```json
{"seq":3,"ts":1786230000000,"type":"message","message":{"role":"user",...}}
```

A reader can resume after a given `seq` (`sinceSeq`). Concurrent tool results get their `seq` from a write queue in the store, so numbers never collide. A collision would make such a reader drop messages with no error (`packages/core/test/store.test.ts` covers that regression).

## Development

After a change, run the lot:

```bash
pnpm check     # lint + style + i18n + typecheck + arch + test
```

Or one piece:

```bash
pnpm lint          # oxlint, --deny-warnings: a warning is a failure
pnpm typecheck     # 5 packages
pnpm test          # unit tests, including component tests. node:test, not vitest or jest
pnpm arch          # dependency direction, a couple of seconds
pnpm package       # this machine's installer. the only place besides a release that runs electron-builder
```
